<p>This month’s trades are in!</p>
<p>On December 1, my Fast Follow Investor model made some big moves:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="december-2022-allocations">December 2022 Allocations</h2>
<ul>
<li>~50% International equities (tickers SCZ, EFA, VGK)</li>
<li>~25% Gold and commodities (tickers GLD, DBC)</li>
<li>~25% Cash</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;When it comes time to buy and it&rsquo;s the right time, you will not want to.
When it comes time to sell and it&rsquo;s the right time, you will not want to.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember: Just like Buy &amp; Hold, Fast Follow trend investing requires fortitude to stick with it.</p>
<p>One last point:
Notice that last decade&rsquo;s top performers are completely absent: US equities and big tech! Has the tide turned? Only time will tell&hellip;</p>

			 <p><em>Use these quick calculations to determine your savings at a future date&hellip;</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can put away your spreadsheet(s). :-) Instead, jot down your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing savings balance</li>
<li>Investment rate of return (expected)</li>
<li>Long-term inflation rate (estimated)</li>
<li>#years your savings can grow</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll walk you through an example.</p>
<p>In doing so, I&rsquo;ll introduce you to the <strong>Rule of 72</strong>, how to calculate <strong>real rate of return</strong>, how <strong>doubling</strong> simplifies the compounding calculation and <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong> (as a bonus).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use these values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing savings: $1.75M</li>
<li>Investment rate of return: 12%</li>
<li>Inflation rate: 4%</li>
<li>#years to grow: 45 years
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-72">The Rule of 72</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rule of 72 is a &ldquo;back of the envelope&rdquo; approximation used to estimate the years required to double an amount of money at a given rate of return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rule: 72 / &ldquo;rate of return&rdquo; = &ldquo;# years to double&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Using my #s: 72 / 12 = 6 years to double.</p>
<p>That sounds great. But six years isn&rsquo;t realistic.</p>
<p>We need to adjust the 12% rate, which is a nominal rate.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="calculating-real-rate-of-return">Calculating Real Rate of Return</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The real rate of return is the annual percentage of profit earned on an investment, adjusted for inflation. The real return rate indicates money&rsquo;s actual purchasing power over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nominal means that a dollar now is worth a dollar later (years later)&hellip;</p>
<p>Given the inflation of late, we can understand why this isn&rsquo;t realistic. A dollar six years from now won&rsquo;t buy as much.</p>
<p>So, to account for inflation, we need to use the &ldquo;real&rdquo; rate of return. We take the &ldquo;rate of return&rdquo; from above and subtract the inflation rate.</p>
<p>For nearly 40 years, inflation hovered near 2%. Right now, it is around 8%.</p>
<p>Many experts believe it will settle around 4% over the long term.</p>
<p>72 / (12 nominal rate - 4 inflation rate) or
72 / 8 = 9 years to double.</p>
<p>Therefore&hellip;</p>
<p>The Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) model I follow doubles my money <em>in real purchasing power</em> every 9 years, assuming a 4% inflation rate.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="power-of-the-double">Power of the Double</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The compounded return is the rate of return of an investment over a cumulative series of time. Doubling is a single case of the compound return equation:  An initial investment is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of doubles. Such as: $1,000 investment x (2)^5 doubles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m 46 years old, almost 47. I&rsquo;m also an optimist and expect to live to at least 92.</p>
<p>In that case, I expect to get another:</p>
<p>92 - 47 = 45 years of life.</p>
<p>45 / 9 years to double = 5 more doubles.</p>
<p>Starting with savings of $1.75M:</p>
<p>$1.75M x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = $56M in real terms, at age 92.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="pressure-testing-the-outcome">Pressure-Testing the Outcome</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sensitivity analysis determines how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;ll vary the real rate of return to see its impact on my savings growth.</p>
<p>But first&hellip;</p>
<p>What is absolutely necessary to make the $56M outcome possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>I need at least a 12% annual return (nominal). This is where my Fast Follow Investor.com TAA strategy comes in.</li>
<li>I need at most a 4% long-term inflation rate. I must count on the Federal Reserve to help control this!</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if my 8% real return drops to 6%?</p>
<p>Perhaps my nominal return comes in at 11% with a long-term inflation rate of 5% (11-5 = 6).</p>
<p>Adjusting the real return from 8% to 6% increases a 9-year double to a 12-year double.</p>
<p>45 / 12 = 3.75 doubles.</p>
<p>3.75 doubles reduce my savings at age 92 from $56M to $23.5M.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly less, but I&rsquo;ll still take it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="so-in-summary">So, in Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Investment return minus inflation rate = real return</li>
<li>72 / real return = # years to double</li>
<li>Remaining years of life / # years to double = # of doubles</li>
<li>Existing savings x 2^(# of doubles) gives you your savings target, in real dollars</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing your # of doubles keeps those spreadsheets at bay!

<p>Like many of you, I am fascinated by the collapse of FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The juicy details will make for a great Netflix series.</p>
<p>But, beyond the high-profile storylines, I have been thinking a lot about how everyone missed this&hellip; including me. Why did I miss this?</p>
<p>I have watched crypto from the sidelines for the last 3 years, often thinking I had missed out.</p>
<p>To console myself, I read about the sketchy characters, the crypto bros, and the money laundering. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not in this.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t ignore Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>He came from traditional finance. He was smart. He (seemingly) supported regulation. He was relatable&hellip;a normal guy. He kept me interested enough to think crypto might be for me.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is human nature to get wrapped up in a one-sided story.</p>
<p>Up until Sunday, Nov 6 these are the headlines associated with Sam.</p>
<ul>
<li>The next Warren Buffett? <em>Fortune</em></li>
<li>The mogul who mastered Washington. <em>Forbes</em></li>
<li>The JP Morgan of crypto. <em>Jim Cramer</em></li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And, since Nov 6, he is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bernie Madoff of crypto</li>
<li>Sam Bankman-Fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative articles are coming fast and furious.</p>
<p>Here is one:

<p>We love heroes, and we love villains.</p>
<p>But, I have to remind myself: the truth exists somewhere in the middle. It always does.</p>
<p>Life is messy.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“If you only hear one side of the story, you have no understanding at all.”</strong><br>
— Chinua Achebe
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will try to apply this lesson to my own beliefs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek out counter-arguments</li>
<li>Assess both sides of the story</li>
<li>Only then make my judgment</li>
<li>Find my truths (not blindly adhering to the tribe&rsquo;s truths)
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

</ul>
<p><strong>A related note about Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</strong></p>
<p>This is new. Be open-minded. It will conflict with certain investment beliefs that you may hold.</p>
<p>But also be critical. TAA cannot erase investment risk. The 60/40 buy &amp; hold portfolio doesn&rsquo;t work in inflationary times. TAA falters when markets whipsaw or experience steep intramonth declines.</p>
<p>The result of learning more?</p>
<ul>
<li>At best, I’ll open your mind to a new investing strategy.</li>
<li>At worst, you’ll consider my evidence and it will further validate your existing strategies.

<p>On Nov 13, the Wall Street Journal published</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-retirement-stocks-bonds-market-11668015638?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1">The Classic 60-40 Investment Strategy Falls Apart. ‘There’s No Place to Hide.’</a></p>
<p>(the article may be behind a firewall)</p>
<p>My 5 takeaways from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Market losses impact real people. There is a community in this, and you are not alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article buried the lead: Why isn&rsquo;t 60/40 working? Inflation. What has worked for the last 40 years will likely be different in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual investors need a system beyond 60/40 that can adapt to varying economic conditions, not just a disinflationary one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I disagree with blind commitment from financial advisors to stick with 60/40. We can&rsquo;t know the future. Will it be inflationary or recessionary? Or both? Or neither?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are resilient. I would be doing exactly what Johnathan Bowden is doing in his situation. I wish everyone featured in the article good fortune, prosperity, and happiness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Inflation hurts everyone.</p>
<p>And getting it under control must be the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s highest priority.</p>

			 <p><em>Despite popular belief, you need NOT accept market risk.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Last week I <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">shared</a> that Meta would need to double two times over (grow 300%) to recover from its 75% loss in 2022.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about how to better convey the sheer tragedy of this fact.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are two years to retirement.  You&rsquo;re only two years away from &ldquo;hanging it up&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;living the good life&rdquo;. You have $2M in savings and are feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>Then, over the next six months, your investments drops to $500K (75% loss).</p>
<p>How would you feel?</p>
<p>I know how I would. Lots of tears. And then back to work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you&rsquo;re not dumb enough to put $2M of retirement savings in Facebook stock alone. (Neither am I.)</p>
<p>Severe losses, though, aren&rsquo;t limited to individual stocks!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look back at some inopportune years to retire:</p>
<hr>
<p>2008: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis
S&amp;P 500 loss: 57%
Time to recover: 17 months</p>
<p>2000: The Dotcom Bubble
Nasdaq loss: 77%
Time to recover: 15 years</p>
<p>1973: The Oil Crisis and Economic Recession
Market loss: 48%
Time to recover: 21 months</p>
<p>1929: The Worst Crash in History
Dow loss: 89%
Time to recover: 25 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Entire markets can drop 50%+. And the road to recovery can vary: from  17 months (when the Fed gets involved) to 25 years (when it does not).</p>
<p>Significant market drops are normal.</p>
<p>But accepting market risk is not required.</p>
<p>Fast Follow investors cut our losses. In doing so, we manage market risk.

<p>I hope that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed my short series on minimizing loss.

<p>In summary:</p>
<p>*Entire markets can drop by 50% or more, setting you way back.</p>
<p>*<a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">Investment losses</a> are asymmetric and compound exponentially. Losses take a long time to dig out from.</p>

			 <p>This year (as of October 27), six companies together have lost one trillion $$ in market capitalization. They are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta/Facebook.</p>
<p>Meta has <a href="https://twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1585743261054152704?s=20&amp;t=G6_paIdH8iMxmk_EsMKrbA">crashed</a>, losing nearly 75% of its value on the year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Instead of discussing the merits of Facebook&rsquo;s business or how much money it&rsquo;s spending on Second Life 2.0, I&rsquo;d like to highlight the math behind this 75% loss.</p>
<p>The math behind crashes is brutal.</p>
<p>When asked what gain is required to recover from a 75% loss, most people will answer a 75% gain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not correct. The answer is a <em>300% gain</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if you lose $75 of an initial $100, you are left with $25. To recover, you must make $75 back (obviously). But, $75 is 3x your (now) $25 investment or a 300% gain.</p>
<p>Here is another way to look at it:</p>
<p>You must double your money twice over: turn $25 into $50, and then $50 into $100. Using an estimated 10% stock market return, it will take you <em>14.5 years</em> just to break even.</p>
<p>Facebook investors who bought on January 1, 2022 and continue to hold have a long road ahead.</p>
<p>This table shows gains required to recover losses ranging from 5% to 90%. As losses steepen, the pain accelerates.</p>

<p>It makes sense why Warren Buffett&rsquo;s two rules of investing are:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Rule #1</strong>: Never lose money. <strong>Rule #2</strong>: Never forget Rule #1.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->

</blockquote>
<p>Severe losses really set you back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the math of it!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In 1985, I was nine years old and joined my dad for a 45-minute drive to an A&amp;W restaurant in a neighboring town.</p>
<p>The A&amp;W is still there. In fact, I drove through Wautoma, Wisconsin and saw it this summer.</p>
<p>My dad had a business meeting with a man named Vern Taggatz. While the two men spoke, I wasted time in the restaurant parking lot kicking rocks.</p>
<p>My dad was a &ldquo;businessman&rdquo;. He worked for Speed Queen, an appliance company, as a middle manager.</p>
<p>On the side (a side gig!), he and my mom invested in a couple of houses, flipping them. I helped paint. And I stayed out of the way.</p>
<p>At the A&amp;W, my dad was discussing an opportunity to invest in a new apartment complex in Plover, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Little did I know at the time I was part of something that is now all the rage: a commercial real estate syndication.</p>
<p>It took about an hour. Finally, the meeting was over.</p>
<p>On the drive home, I learned that my dad and Vern did the deal.</p>
<p>Years later, I learned that my dad invested about $20,000.</p>
<p>Even more years later, I learned that Vern defrauded my father.</p>
<p>In 1985, several small investors cut checks to Vern Taggatz who ran off with the money.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>My dad was smart. He is still smart.</p>
<p>I try to be like him in many ways. Too much, in fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in management (management consulting). I&rsquo;m entrepreneurial. I love investing.</p>
<p>I bought a high-priced, whole life insurance policy right out of college that I did not need nor could afford.</p>
<p>Double ouch.</p>
<p>The lesson?</p>
<p>When presented with an investment opportunity, really question it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How exactly does it work?</li>
<li>Where is the value?</li>
<li>What is the downside?</li>
<li>How well do I know this person?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the investment opportunity doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> right, it probably isn&rsquo;t!</p>

			 <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting everyone as I create a new community of do-it-yourself investors.

<p>To start, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a husband of 20+ years, father of 10+ years, and management consultant/ business owner.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated with investments and the economy. I have recently become intrigued by purpose and passion.

<p>Why <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>? That&rsquo;s easy&hellip; I&rsquo;m introducing do-it-yourself investors to a personal investment strategy called <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/">Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</a>.</p>
<p>TAA generates investment returns for you to achieve financial independence. And it protects against losses so you can sleep well in this wonderful, new stage of life.</p>
<p>More DIY investors should know about it.

<p>At <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>, I want my posts to show some personality and prove enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>If I do it right, we&rsquo;ll also learn together and have fun doing it.

<p>A little more about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Friends tell me that I&rsquo;m great to watch a comedy with. They laugh at me laughing at the movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storm in New Orleans flooded my car up to the steering wheel. A total loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will want to cook dinner for me because every meal I eat is the best meal I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love swimming, skiing, and other fun on the lake. My grandparents owned a cabin in Northern Wisconsin, and now my wife and I do too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My sister competed in the Miss America pageant!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My spirit animal is a dog. I&rsquo;m a dependable and trusted companion, and I always live in the present (both good and bad).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our terrier, Izzie, is over 15 years old and still escaping from the yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One regret I have in life is not traveling for long periods overseas when I was younger. I want to make up for that soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life granted me a great many privileges and only in the last several years have I realized it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been thinking about writing for a long time and now simply must do it. I&rsquo;m very excited to start this adventure with you!
