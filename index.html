<p>Like many of you, I am fascinated by the collapse of FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The juicy details will make for a great Netflix series.</p>
<p>But, beyond the high-profile storylines, I have been thinking a lot about how everyone missed this&hellip; including me. Why did I miss this?</p>
<p>I have watched crypto from the sidelines for the last 3 years, often thinking I had missed out.</p>
<p>To console myself, I read about the sketchy characters, the crypto bros, and the money laundering. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not in this.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t ignore Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>He came from traditional finance. He was smart. He (seemingly) supported regulation. He was relatable&hellip;a normal guy. He kept me interested enough to think crypto might be for me.

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is human nature to get wrapped up in a one-sided story.</p>
<p>Up until Sunday, Nov 6 these are the headlines associated with Sam.</p>
<ul>
<li>The next Warren Buffett? <em>Fortune</em></li>
<li>The mogul who mastered Washington. <em>Forbes</em></li>
<li>The JP Morgan of crypto. <em>Jim Cramer</em></li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And, since Nov 6, he is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bernie Madoff of crypto</li>
<li>Sam Bankman-Fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative articles are coming fast and furious.</p>
<p>Here is one:

<p>We love heroes, and we love villains.</p>
<p>But, I have to remind myself: the truth exists somewhere in the middle. It always does.</p>
<p>Life is messy.

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will try to apply this lesson to my own beliefs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek out counter-arguments</li>
<li>Assess both sides of the story</li>
<li>Only then make my judgment</li>
<li>Find my truths (not blindly adhering to the tribe&rsquo;s truths)

</ul>
<p><strong>A related note about Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</strong></p>
<p>This is new. Be open-minded. It will conflict with certain investment beliefs that you may hold.</p>
<p>But also be critical. TAA cannot erase investment risk. The 60/40 buy &amp; hold portfolio doesn&rsquo;t work in inflationary times. TAA falters when markets whipsaw or experience steep intramonth declines.</p>
<p>The result of learning more?</p>
<ul>
<li>At best, I’ll open your mind to a new investing strategy.</li>
<li>At worst, you’ll consider my evidence and it will further validate your existing strategies.

<p>On Nov 13, the Wall Street Journal published</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-retirement-stocks-bonds-market-11668015638?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1">The Classic 60-40 Investment Strategy Falls Apart. ‘There’s No Place to Hide.’</a></p>
<p>(the article may be behind a firewall)</p>
<p>My 5 takeaways from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Market losses impact real people. There is a community in this, and you are not alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article buried the lead: Why isn&rsquo;t 60/40 working? Inflation. What has worked for the last 40 years will likely be different in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual investors need a system beyond 60/40 that can adapt to varying economic conditions, not just a disinflationary one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I disagree with blind commitment from financial advisors to stick with 60/40. We can&rsquo;t know the future. Will it be inflationary or recessionary? Or both? Or neither?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are resilient. I would be doing exactly what Johnathan Bowden is doing in his situation. I wish everyone featured in the article good fortune, prosperity, and happiness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Inflation hurts everyone.</p>
<p>And getting it under control must be the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s highest priority.</p>

			 <p><em>Despite popular belief, you need NOT accept market risk.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Last week I <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">shared</a> that Meta would need to double two times over (grow 300%) to recover from its 75% loss in 2022.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about how to better convey the sheer tragedy of this fact.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are two years to retirement.  You&rsquo;re only two years away from &ldquo;hanging it up&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;living the good life&rdquo;. You have $2M in savings and are feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>Then, over the next six months, your investments drops to $500K (75% loss).</p>
<p>How would you feel?</p>
<p>I know how I would. Lots of tears. And then back to work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you&rsquo;re not dumb enough to put $2M of retirement savings in Facebook stock alone. (Neither am I.)</p>
<p>Severe losses, though, aren&rsquo;t limited to individual stocks!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look back at some inopportune years to retire:</p>
<hr>
<p>2008: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis
S&amp;P 500 loss: 57%
Time to recover: 17 months</p>
<p>2000: The Dotcom Bubble
Nasdaq loss: 77%
Time to recover: 15 years</p>
<p>1973: The Oil Crisis and Economic Recession
Market loss: 48%
Time to recover: 21 months</p>
<p>1929: The Worst Crash in History
Dow loss: 89%
Time to recover: 25 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Entire markets can drop 50%+. And the road to recovery can vary: from  17 months (when the Fed gets involved) to 25 years (when it does not).</p>
<p>Significant market drops are normal.</p>
<p>But accepting market risk is not required.</p>
<p>Fast Follow investors cut our losses. In doing so, we manage market risk.

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>*Entire markets can drop by 50% or more, setting you way back.</p>
<p>*<a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">Investment losses</a> are asymmetric and compound exponentially. Losses take a long time to dig out from.</p>

<p>In November, my diversified Fast Follower TAA investment model redeployed some cash:</p>
<ul>
<li>13.5% was allocated to the DBC Commodities ETF. Let&rsquo;s see how this trade fares given OPEC&rsquo;s decision to restrict oil drilling and Russia&rsquo;s exit from the Ukraine grain deal.</li>
<li>The model inched into the SPY S&amp;P 500 Index ETF. The S&amp;P gained nearly ~8% in October, but the TAA model isn&rsquo;t convinced we&rsquo;re in a new bull market.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">It will take 14.5 years for some investors to recover their Facebook losses </a></h1>

			 <p>This year (as of October 27), six companies together have lost one trillion $$ in market capitalization. They are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta/Facebook.</p>
<p>Meta has <a href="https://twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1585743261054152704?s=20&amp;t=G6_paIdH8iMxmk_EsMKrbA">crashed</a>, losing nearly 75% of its value on the year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Instead of discussing the merits of Facebook&rsquo;s business or how much money it&rsquo;s spending on Second Life 2.0, I&rsquo;d like to highlight the math behind this 75% loss.</p>
<p>The math behind crashes is brutal.</p>
<p>When asked what gain is required to recover from a 75% loss, most people will answer a 75% gain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not correct. The answer is a <em>300% gain</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if you lose $75 of an initial $100, you are left with $25. To recover, you must make $75 back (obviously). But, $75 is 3x your (now) $25 investment or a 300% gain.</p>
<p>Here is another way to look at it:</p>
<p>You must double your money twice over: turn $25 into $50, and then $50 into $100. Using an estimated 10% stock market return, it will take you <em>14.5 years</em> just to break even.</p>
<p>Facebook investors who bought on January 1, 2022 and continue to hold have a long road ahead.</p>
<p>This table shows gains required to recover losses ranging from 5% to 90%. As losses steepen, the pain accelerates.</p>

<p>It makes sense why Warren Buffett&rsquo;s two rules of investing are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Rule #1</strong>: Never lose money. <strong>Rule #2</strong>: Never forget Rule #1.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
-Warren Buffett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Severe losses really set you back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the math of it!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In 1985, I was nine years old and joined my dad for a 45-minute drive to an A&amp;W restaurant in a neighboring town.</p>
<p>The A&amp;W is still there. In fact, I drove through Wautoma, Wisconsin and saw it this summer.</p>
<p>My dad had a business meeting with a man named Vern Taggatz. While the two men spoke, I wasted time in the restaurant parking lot kicking rocks.</p>
<p>My dad was a &ldquo;businessman&rdquo;. He worked for Speed Queen, an appliance company, as a middle manager.</p>
<p>On the side (a side gig!), he and my mom invested in a couple of houses, flipping them. I helped paint. And I stayed out of the way.</p>
<p>At the A&amp;W, my dad was discussing an opportunity to invest in a new apartment complex in Plover, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Little did I know at the time I was part of something that is now all the rage: a commercial real estate syndication.</p>
<p>It took about an hour. Finally, the meeting was over.</p>
<p>On the drive home, I learned that my dad and Vern did the deal.</p>
<p>Years later, I learned that my dad invested about $20,000.</p>
<p>Even more years later, I learned that Vern defrauded my father.</p>
<p>In 1985, several small investors cut checks to Vern Taggatz who ran off with the money.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>My dad was smart. He is still smart.</p>
<p>I try to be like him in many ways. Too much, in fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in management (management consulting). I&rsquo;m entrepreneurial. I love investing.</p>
<p>I bought a high-priced, whole life insurance policy right out of college that I did not need nor could afford.</p>
<p>Double ouch.</p>
<p>The lesson?</p>
<p>When presented with an investment opportunity, really question it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How exactly does it work?</li>
<li>Where is the value?</li>
<li>What is the downside?</li>
<li>How well do I know this person?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the investment opportunity doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> right, it probably isn&rsquo;t!</p>

			 <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting everyone as I create a new community of do-it-yourself investors.

<p>To start, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a husband of 20+ years, father of 10+ years, and management consultant/ business owner.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated with investments and the economy. I have recently become intrigued by purpose and passion.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Why <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>? That&rsquo;s easy&hellip; I&rsquo;m introducing do-it-yourself investors to a personal investment strategy called <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/">Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</a>.</p>
<p>TAA generates investment returns for you to achieve financial independence. And it protects against losses so you can sleep well in this wonderful, new stage of life.</p>
<p>More DIY investors should know about it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>, I want my posts to show some personality and prove enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>If I do it right, we&rsquo;ll also learn together and have fun doing it.

<p>A little more about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Friends tell me that I&rsquo;m great to watch a comedy with. They laugh at me laughing at the movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storm in New Orleans flooded my car up to the steering wheel. A total loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will want to cook dinner for me because every meal I eat is the best meal I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love swimming, skiing, and other fun on the lake. My grandparents owned a cabin in Northern Wisconsin, and now my wife and I do too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My sister competed in the Miss America pageant!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My spirit animal is a dog. I&rsquo;m a dependable and trusted companion, and I always live in the present (both good and bad).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our terrier, Izzie, is over 15 years old and still escaping from the yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One regret I have in life is not traveling for long periods overseas when I was younger. I want to make up for that soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life granted me a great many privileges and only in the last several years have I realized it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been thinking about writing for a long time and now simply must do it. I&rsquo;m very excited to start this adventure with you!
