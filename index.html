			 <p>In 1985, I was nine years old and joined my dad for a 45-minute drive to an A&amp;W restaurant in a neighboring town.</p>
<p>The A&amp;W is still there. In fact, I drove through Wautoma, Wisconsin and saw it this summer.</p>
<p>My dad had a business meeting with a man named Vern Taggatz. While the two men spoke, I wasted time in the restaurant parking lot kicking rocks.</p>
<p>My dad was a &ldquo;businessman&rdquo;. He worked for Speed Queen, an appliance company, as a middle manager.</p>
<p>On the side (a side gig!), he and my mom invested in a couple of houses, flipping them. I helped paint. And I stayed out of the way.</p>
<p>At the A&amp;W, my dad was discussing an opportunity to invest in a new apartment complex in Plover, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Little did I know at the time I was part of something that is now all the rage: a commercial real estate syndication.</p>
<p>It took about an hour. Finally, the meeting was over.</p>
<p>On the drive home, I learned that my dad and Vern did the deal.</p>
<p>Years later, I learned that my dad invested about $20,000.</p>
<p>Even more years later, I learned that Vern defrauded my father.</p>
<p>In 1985, several small investors cut checks to Vern Taggatz who ran off with the money.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>My dad was smart. He is still smart.</p>
<p>I try to be like him in many ways. Too much, in fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in management (management consulting). I&rsquo;m entrepreneurial. I love investing.</p>
<p>I bought a high-priced, whole life insurance policy right out of college that I did not need nor could afford.</p>
<p>Double ouch.</p>
<p>The lesson?</p>
<p>When presented with an investment opportunity, really question it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How exactly does it work?</li>
<li>Where is the value?</li>
<li>What is the downside?</li>
<li>How well do I know this person?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the investment opportunity doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> right, it probably isn&rsquo;t!</p>

			 <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting everyone as I create a new community of do-it-yourself investors.

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To start, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a husband of 20+ years, father of 10+ years, and management consultant/ business owner.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated with investments and the economy. I have recently become intrigued by purpose and passion.

<p>Why <a href="https://brianherriot.com/">brianherriot.com</a>? That&rsquo;s easy&hellip; I&rsquo;m introducing do-it-yourself investors to a personal investment strategy called <a href="https://brianherriot.com/invest-like-me/">Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</a>.</p>
<p>TAA generates investment returns for you to achieve financial independence. And it protects against losses so you can sleep well in this wonderful, new stage of life.</p>
<p>More DIY investors should know about it.

<p>At <a href="https://brianherriot.com/">brianherriot.com</a>, I want my posts to show some personality and prove enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>If I do it right, we&rsquo;ll also learn together and have fun doing it.

<p>A little more about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Friends tell me that I&rsquo;m great to watch a comedy with. They laugh at me laughing at the movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storm in New Orleans flooded my car up to the steering wheel. A total loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will want to cook dinner for me because every meal I eat is the best meal I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love swimming, skiing, and other fun on the lake. My grandparents owned a cabin in Northern Wisconsin, and now my wife and I do too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My sister competed in the Miss America pageant!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My spirit animal is a dog. I&rsquo;m a dependable and trusted companion, and I always live in the present (both good and bad).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our terrier, Izzie, is over 15 years old and still escaping from the yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One regret I have in life is not traveling for long periods overseas when I was younger. I want to make up for that soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life granted me a great many privileges and only in the last several years have I realized it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been thinking about writing for a long time and now simply must do it. I&rsquo;m very excited to start this adventure with you!
