			 <p><em>Use these 3 strategies to shave 70% off your supposed retirement savings.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Your retirement savings target (your &ldquo;number&rdquo;) is less than you think you need.</p>
<p>In 2019, personal finance guru Suze Orman announced you need <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-you-need-to-retire-early-retirement_l_5c4790a9e4b0b6693674d32d">$5 Million to live a happy retirement</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Very wrong.</p>
<p>Suze is misinforming those of us working hard to achieve financial independence.</p>
<p>In this post, I will show you how to <strong>shave $3.4 Million off this misguided $5 Million savings target</strong>. All you must do is 1) Review your large expenses, 2) Turn your hobby into a micro-business, and 3) Invest smarter.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, think about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer would you need to work to save an additional $3.4 Million dollars?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope the answer is &ldquo;far too long to even consider it!&rdquo;. In fact, it&rsquo;s likely not even possible for most of us.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s clarify a <em>$5 Million retirement</em>.</p>
<p>The often-used <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-the-4-percent-retirement-savings-rule/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%204%25%20rule%20for%20retirement%3F,for%20inflation%20each%20subsequent%20year.">4% rule</a> translates $5 Million of retirement savings to living on $200,000 annually for 30 years. (More on this 30-year timeframe, later).</p>
<p>Next, we can reduce this $5 Million savings target by ~70% using three strategies.</p>
<p>To do so, we&rsquo;ll build a case to adjust needing $200,000 annually. Then, we&rsquo;ll <em>back into</em> the reduced savings target. And, we&rsquo;ll do this all without sacrificing quality of life in retirement.

<h2 id="1-investigate-large-expenses-to-reduce-spending">#1: Investigate large expenses to reduce spending</h2>
<p>What is the best way to reduce the income needed in retirement? The best way is the most direct way: eliminate unnecessary living expenses.</p>
<p>Please take note! This is not an act of frugality or meant to reduce your quality of life in retirement. I&rsquo;m willing to bet that you can comfortably live on 20% less. Let&rsquo;s shave off $40,000 in spending without feeling it.</p>
<p><em>Exercise #1:</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Look at your annual expenses and do the necessary work to curb your spending. Start with the big expenses: home, car, and health. Can you refinance your mortgage? How about selling a car and biking instead? Have you signed up for a subsidized Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plan at healthcare.gov?</p>
<p><em>Exericise #2:</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Imagine you are an entrepreneur, and it is &ldquo;Day 1&rdquo;. Assume that you can only afford 25% of what you had planned for. In this scenario, your $200,000 annual spend becomes $50,000. What unique changes can you make? This exercise results in extreme ideas that you could later change to be less severe.</p>
<p><em>Exercise #3:</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Learn from others who have come before you. Here are 10 ideas that members of the Fast Follow Investor community have shared with me. You need NOT downsize your home, reduce the # of vacations you take, or eliminate a daily coffee habit!</p>
<p>Instead, you might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cancel subscriptions that you no longer use - save $1,000 each year</li>
<li>Eliminate or reduce insurance premiums (life, long-term disability, auto) - $10,000</li>
<li>Read/listen to books using Libby instead of purchasing on Amazon - $1,000</li>
<li>Program your thermostat and lower the temperature on your water heater - $3,000</li>
<li>Ask for coupon codes via a company website&rsquo;s chatbot before buying online - $1,000</li>
<li>Transition to one car and save on maintenance, licensing, and insurance - $6,000</li>
<li>Switch to a subsidized healthcare plan through healthcare.gov - $10,000</li>
<li>Refinance your mortgage - $3,000</li>
<li>Stop supporting your kids (cell phone bills, bank overdraft fees). They are adults now. - $1,000</li>
<li>Commit to &ldquo;wait one week to buy&rdquo; after placing an item in your Amazon shopping cart - $4,000</li>
</ol>
<p>Total annual savings: $40,000</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t fret about inflation. Even with inflation, <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/age-banding-by-basu-to-model-retirement-spending-needs-by-category/">studies</a> show that the average retiree&rsquo;s spending drops by 25% for every 10 years in retirement. If you retire early, you should adjust that assumption. But, in case you don&rsquo;t believe me: think about how much your 85-year-old mother spends on travel, for example. Spending <em>in real terms</em> declines as you age.

<p>With reduced spending, we are now living a $5 Million retirement on $4 Million in savings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s $1 Million less savings required! How many fewer years of work is that? 10 years? More?</p>
<p>But we can do better&hellip;

<h2 id="2-you-will-want-to-stay-busy-so-get-paid-for-it">#2: You will want to stay busy, so get paid for it.</h2>
<p>Any income earned in retirement is that much less you need to save!</p>
<p>I often hear this concern: &ldquo;But wait, if I&rsquo;m working then I&rsquo;m not retired.&rdquo; Yes and no. It depends on how you&rsquo;re earning this retirement income. Also, after relaxing in retirement for a while, you may realize you need some purpose back in your life. Earning money <em>on your terms this time</em> is a way to get it. For example, why not work a few half days at a local cafe? It&rsquo;s a great way to stay connected with friends and the community.</p>
<p>My grandfather and my father-in-law both worked in retirement for reasons beyond money.</p>
<ul>
<li>My grandpa Kenny&rsquo;s career as a plumber lead him to work as a sales associate at his local Ace Hardware. Before taking the job, he confided in me about his boredom: &ldquo;Brian, I can only rotate the wheels on the vacuum cleaner so many times.&rdquo; At Ace Hardware, he helped customers find what they needed. But mostly, he loved chatting with them. My grandpa was an expert joke teller.</li>
<li>My father-in-law, Robin&rsquo;s situation was similar. He loves golf. Robin works several days a week now as a starter at his favorite golf course. He jokes with the golfing regulars all day. He spins his yarns. And he gets a paycheck. And free golf!</li>
</ul>
<p>I can think of several options for making money when retired.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rent out that extra room in your basement. Or, if you travel for part of the year, rent out your house during that time.</li>
<li>While very few kickback permanently in retirement, it&rsquo;s especially true of early retirees. Those quicker to find financial independence are especially likely to pick up a new job or career.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Do you like people? Work part-time at your favorite coffee house.</li>
<li>Do you like books? Work at the library.</li>
<li>Are you fortunate enough to have seasonal skills? A retired accountant could pick up work during the busy tax season, then be off in time for the summer.</li>
<li>Do you like your former colleagues? You could consult with your former employer for part of the year.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Perhaps you have a hobby or passion project. Find <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 true fans</a> and watch the money roll in. My uncle-in-law, Howard, is the foremost expert on Mazda RX-7 and RX-8 cars. He&rsquo;s an absolute true fan of the Rotary engine. And he&rsquo;s an expert. Each year, Mazda RX fans spend oodles of time and money working with Howard.</li>
</ol>
<p>The options are endless.</p>
<p>Here are a few opportunities that add up to $80,000 per year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put your house on Airbnb or VRBO. Rent it out during an extended trip you take to earn $10,000.</li>
<li>Do seasonal work or part-time consulting. Charge $15,000 for each of the 3 months and earn $45,000.</li>
<li>Monetize a hobby or passion. Sell $250 worth of <em>something</em> to 100 true fans to earn $25,000.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Calculation:</em>
($160K less $80K earned = $80K needed)/4% = $2M savings target, updated.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With some income in retirement, we are now living a $5 Million retirement on $2 Million in savings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another $2 Million less savings required! Wow. Let&rsquo;s find more&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="3-maximize-the-withdrawal-rate-on-your-savings">#3: Maximize the withdrawal rate on your savings</h2>
<p>The final strategy is the easiest to implement. You need <em>not</em> cut spending or monetize hobbies. Instead, just invest your nest egg smarter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit the 4% rule that I used earlier. The rule first appeared in 1994 after studying a 60%-40% U.S. stock-to-bond portfolio over different 30 years periods in history. But, using a 4% safe withdrawal rate (SWR) is inaccurate for two important reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is based on an inferior investment strategy (60/40). You can invest for greater return and less risk.</li>
<li>It is timebound to 30 years. What if you want to stay retired for 35 years? 50 years? Or longer?</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s use 5% as the corrected, perpetual withdrawal rate (PWR). To do so, the Fast Follow Investor strategy is necessary. I break it down further in this [post](to update with SWR/PWR post).</p>
<p>So, our $80,000 annual income in retirement no longer requires $2 Million in savings.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><em>Calculation:</em>
$80K needed/updated 5% withdrawal rate = $1.6M savings target, updated.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is $400,000 less savings required.</p>
<p>In total, the three strategies reduced our retirement savings required by $3.4 Million.</p>
<p>So there you have it: with a little work, your $5 Million nest egg need only be $1.6 Million!</p>
<p>$1.6 Million still requires work to build. To do it, I urge you to follow the <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/13/this-is-my.html">Idols Framework</a> for smarter wealth creation. But it is calming to know you needn&rsquo;t stay in your job decades longer to save an <em>unnecessary</em>, extra $3.4 Million.</p>
<p>Please, do this analysis for yourselves!</p>
<p>I suspect many of you reading this are financially independent NOW. But, you may not have realized it. Make the jump. Take the plunge. You can do it.

			 <p><em>The 4% Rule is a dangerous myth based on a faulty premise. Ignore Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR) and maximize Perpetual Withdrawal Rate (PWR) to enjoy 50+ years of financial freedom.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Why do we save? For nearly all of us, we save for retirement income later in life.</p>
<p>We use the 4% rule to estimate how much we can withdraw each year of a 30-year retirement. We use 3.5% if we plan to retire early.</p>
<p><em>I would like to introduce you to the &ldquo;5% Forever&rdquo; Rule.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="you-and-i-want-more-than-30-years-of-financial-freedom">You and I want more than 30 years of financial freedom.</h2>
<p>My goal is financial independence at 50 years old. With medical advancements, I expect to live until 100 years old. So, I need my savings to last me 50 years.</p>
<p>The 4% rule governs the land. It&rsquo;s close to becoming <em>conventional wisdom</em>. And I&rsquo;m not a big fan of conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Some quick history.</p>
<p>A financial planner named Bill Bengen first advocated the 4% rule over 25 years ago, in 1994. His clients had questions about how much they could safely withdraw from their nest eggs.</p>
<p>Bengen looked at U.S. market data from 1926 to 1992. He determined that given a portfolio split between stocks and bonds would survive a 4% safe withdrawal rate (SWR) for a retirement lasting 30 years.</p>
<p>4% withdrawn annually would not deplete a portfolio of U.S. stocks (60%) and bonds (40%).</p>
<p>But, consider where Bengen&rsquo;s analysis wouldn&rsquo;t hold up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most other time periods in U.S. history.</li>
<li>Anywhere other than the United States.</li>
<li>For a time period any longer than 30 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 4% rule was built on shaky ground. It&rsquo;s not a very robust #.</p>
<p>In fact, since it was published in 1994, a lot of work has been done to validate 4%. It now appears the more robust % for a 60/40 portfolio is 3.5%. The problem is that &ldquo;4% rule&rdquo; is so nice and memorable. And now it&rsquo;s hard to change.</p>
<p>I recommend thinking in terms of a forever rate, or as it is more commonly called, a perpetual withdrawal rate (PWR). At what rate, can you withdraw from savings <em>forever</em>?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="three-factors-determine-how-much-you-can-spend-each-year">Three factors determine how much you can spend each year.</h2>
<p>With financial experts recently suggesting that 4% be lowered to 3.5%, how can I advocate raising it to 5%?</p>
<p>The short answer is to adjust how the underlying investment portfolio is constructed. There is a better solution than U.S. stocks (60%) and bonds (40%).</p>
<p>But first, let&rsquo;s investigate what factors impact the withdrawal rate. There are three.</p>
<p><strong>No. 1 and the most well-known is <em>investment rate of return</em>.</strong>
A greater investment return is, of course, better. Growing your portfolio faster supports the ability to withdraw larger sums. But this is just one factor.</p>
<p><strong>No. 2 is <em>inflation</em>.</strong>
If inflation stays low, the cost of living stays low. And investments can grow to easily cover the cost of future expenses.</p>
<p>Inflation can be addressed in your portfolio by owning Treasury Inflations Protected Bond Securities (TIPS). But I recommend doing so only as part of the Fast Follow Investor portfolio.</p>
<p>A better way to protect against inflation is to control how and where you spend money. I call it smart spending. For example, when egg prices are outrageous, buy milk, yogurt, and cheese for protein.</p>
<p><strong>No. 3 will make sense but is discussed much less: investment return <em>volatility</em>.</strong>
Low volatility means that your nest egg is protected from steep and severe losses. When volatility is high and investments decline sharply, you&rsquo;re forced to withdraw savings when portfolio values are low. This is commonly called &ldquo;sequence of return risk&rdquo;. (Why are financial terms made to be so complicated?)</p>
<p>In summary, to maximize your forever rate, control inflation with smart spending. Then, invest in a portfolio that offers high returns with low volatility.

<h2 id="use-the-fast-follow-investor-portfolio-to-withdraw-at-5-forever">Use the Fast Follow Investor portfolio to withdraw at 5% forever.</h2>
<p>The Fast Follow Investor portfolio offers strong, stable investment growth. It&rsquo;s predicted to earn 12% annually through <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/20/use-this-x.html">all economic cycles</a>.</p>
<p>But, the best feature of the Fast Follow Investor portfolio is its 3-year positive return profile. This means a negative return recovers to neutral within 3 years. It&rsquo;s only possible because it manages losses, limiting them to a 3-year period historically. This is kind of amazing.</p>
<p>Think about it. Start with $50,000 invested. Once it goes negative (which it will), the portfolio will find its way back to $50,000 again within 3 years. Compare that to 10 years for the U.S. stock market. The stock market return for the lost decade of 2000-2010 was 0%!</p>
<p>The Fast Follow Investor portfolio&rsquo;s 12% return and 3-year positive return profile work together to achieve a 5% annual withdrawal rate&hellip;to infinity.</p>
<p>And that is the 5% Forever Rule!</p>
<p>Retire whenever you&rsquo;d like to and comfortably withdraw more of your invested savings. Just be sure your savings align with the Fast Follow Investor portfolio.

<p>My wife and I sat in a church basement completing worksheets of chores we would each do when married. It was then that we identified our key to a happy marriage: a dishwasher. Thank goodness for this marriage preparedness class!</p>
<p>We married in 2001. Both 25 years old, we had no grand plan for what life together would look like. Beyond getting a dishwasher, life was open-ended. I assumed &ldquo;things would just work out&rdquo;.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<h2 id="the-first-20-years">The first 20 years</h2>
<p>The years passed and life happened. Personal goals. Professional goals. Our son was born in 2011. We traversed life &ldquo;just fine&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t think about it too much. I put my head down, went to work, made money, vacationed, hung out with the family, and repeated it for years.</p>
<p>It took me 20 years to finally see that I had no vision for what I wanted our lives to be. I was 45.</p>
<p>Conversely, my wife only seemed to think about <em>big</em> things. Why are we here? Where are we going?  What is our purpose?</p>
<p>Up to that point:</p>
<ul>
<li>I handled work and &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;. She carried the emotional burden.</li>
<li>I lived in the present. She looked to the future.</li>
<li>I thought about money. She thought about life.</li>
</ul>
<p>We needed a solution for combining forces. We could no longer &ldquo;wing it&rdquo;. We would need to work together to design a purposeful and more connected life.</p>
<p>It continues to be our goal for the next 20 years.

<h2 id="trial-and-error">Trial and error</h2>
<p>My epiphany for planning a well-intentioned life didn&rsquo;t happen all at once. It took place over many months. Covid-19 shook me out of a life of &ldquo;going through the motions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To improve our unity and direction, my wife and I decided to meet weekly and make some plans. We mapped out what needed doing that week, fun weekend plans, and long-term activities to work on together. The discussions morphed from tactical to aspirational and back again.</p>
<p>But we had many fits and starts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking at night didn&rsquo;t work. That kid kept interrupting.</li>
<li>In the morning failed. We have different sleep schedules.</li>
<li>We committed to meeting in person, but that also proved unreliable.</li>
<li>We settled on mid-day meetings by Zoom. And, yes! It worked for a while.</li>
<li>But then, we&rsquo;d miss a week and the schedule unraveled for two more.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, <em>for us</em>, the weekly meeting became too much. We couldn&rsquo;t get it to fit in with many, other commitments.</p>
<p>Our efforts were completely derailed for several months, until my wife recognized it. Since our time meeting weekly, we had both grown. We learned some things&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="monthly-date-night">Monthly date night</h2>
<p>We now meet monthly. We like it, because it&rsquo;s efficient and with only 12 dates a year, there is <strong>absolutely</strong> no reason to miss. For us, these are date nights. You might also call them meet-ups. Over the course an evening, we discuss all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>At first, the dates were tactical.</p>
<p>We would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange for our son to be away.</li>
<li>Order takeout.</li>
<li>Discuss plans for the coming month.
That was it!</li>
</ul>
<p>The next stage became more strategic.</p>
<p>Additionally, we would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit one life and one money goal we set for the year.</li>
<li>Plan an interesting activity for the month (to &ldquo;make a memory!&quot;).</li>
<li>Find new ways to connect with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the date night looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes we do takeout and sometimes we go out!</li>
<li>We pick and choose our conversation topics. Some months we cover life or connection or money or a combination.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, we never miss a date.

<h2 id="why-does-it-work">Why does it work?</h2>
<p>I <strong>truly</strong> believe that a monthly date night leads to deeper connections, more wealth, and a more well-intentioned life.</p>
<p>And now, I think I know why. I recently read Charles Duhigg&rsquo;s book, The Power of Habit. In it, he describes the <em>keystone habit</em>.</p>
<p>A keystone habit is one that leads to a cascade of other positive actions. It&rsquo;s a habit that has a ripple effect&hellip;from it, other good habits form.</p>
<p>The book offers two examples…</p>
<ol>
<li>Sleep. Commit to 8 hours of sleep a night and wake up rested and ready to make many other good decisions throughout the day.</li>
<li>Exercise. Commit to 30 minutes in the morning and feel better all day. You&rsquo;ll think clearer and tend to eat more healthy foods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Life is hard. Work. Relationships. Kids. Friendships. Health. There is so much to think about and work on.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t I just focus on one thing to jump-start everything else?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not one. But, how about three things?</p>
<p>First, focus on yourself: 1) get enough sleep and 2) exercise daily and other dominoes will start to fall.</p>
<p>Then, 3) commit to a monthly date night! With proper guidance, it can lead to a deeper relationship, more money, and a better life. I will help you.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to see what the next 20 years have in store for us&hellip;

			 <p><em>Second-level thinking is a form of deep learning that can help you develop an edge. I call this principle &ldquo;Think Again&rdquo; which is foundational to smart investors.</em>

<p>In his book, The Most Important Thing, Howard Marks explains it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas first-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and everyone can do it, second-level thinking is deep, complex, and convoluted.

<p>Search Youtube for Howard Marks-Second Level Thinking. It&rsquo;s a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0APs1ObxF8">2-minute video</a>.</p>
<p>How does it help the individual investor?</p>
<p>As a first-level thinking index investor, I once believed as fact that <strong>markets are efficient</strong>. Entire books are written about it (e.g. A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Burton Malkiel). But when markets crashed in March 2020, how could that be efficient? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Second-level thinkers would dive deeper to learn more. Perhaps, <strong>markets are <em>mostly</em> efficient, but with periods of extreme volatility</strong>. It&rsquo;s a more complicated and nuanced portrayal of markets. This must be understood, though, to become a better investor.</p>
<p>Second-level thinking is hard. And it takes time. But it makes you better. It gives you an <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html">edge</a>.

			 <p><em>I offer my thesis, the &ldquo;Idols Framework for wealth creation&rdquo;, for your review. Calling for 25% Buffett, 25% Walton, 25% Bogle, and 25% Thorpe, it&rsquo;s a recipe for you to absorb, adopt, and adapt.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have refined my formula for smart wealth creation in the last five years. Is it a secret formula? No. Is it prescriptive or one-size-fits-all? No, and no.</p>
<p>But, the formula has merit. And I wish I had known it earlier. The Idols Framework is foundational. With it in place, I can enjoy the adventure of life.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="enjoyable-stress-free-wealth-accumulation">Enjoyable, stress-free wealth accumulation</h2>
<p>You can determine the value of your time by calculating your earnings per hour worked. It makes sense to hire out jobs costing less than this measure. Unless you enjoy the job for other reasons (a hobby, for instance)&hellip;</p>
<p>Successful individuals like <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html">Ed Thorpe</a> drive the measure higher: What is the most money you could earn for the least amount of work?</p>
<p>My variation on personal <em>earnings per hour</em> adjusts the factors slightly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of <em>earnings</em>, I&rsquo;m interested in <em>wealth</em>.</li>
<li>I redefine <em>time spent (per hour)</em> to <em>stress-level</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>My measure becomes <em>wealth created per stress endured</em>. The goal is a high score.</p>
<p>Two scenarios produce a high score:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;The Bezos&rdquo; This is extreme wealth with significant stress. The high score is due to a large wealth factor.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Vagabond&rdquo; This is modest, even minimal wealth, with near zero stress. The high score can be attributed to a small stress factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I had to pick one, I prefer &ldquo;The Vagabond&rdquo;. Stress is real, and it shortens lives. In the end, all we have is time.  Also, does extreme wealth make us happier?!</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m shooting for somewhere in the middle. Likely, we all are. We would like <em>enough</em> wealth accumulated for the least stress. (<em>Enough</em> means financially independent.)</p>
<p>How then?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="idols-framework-for-wealth-creation">Idols Framework for wealth creation</h2>
<p>We will create wealth using the Idols Framework. It is a loose business and investment portfolio that I will dissect in great detail in future posts. For now, know that the Idols Framework starts with equal parts Buffett, Walton, Bogle, and Thorpe:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% Warren Buffett, of Berkshire Hathaway fame [<strong>margin of safety</strong>]</li>
<li>25% Sam Walton, from Walmart [<strong>micro-business</strong>]</li>
<li>25% John Bogle, founder of Vanguard [<strong>buy &amp; hold indexing</strong>]</li>
<li>25% <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html">Ed Thorpe</a>, math genius who beat Vegas and Wall Street [<strong>quantitative trend</strong>]</li>
</ul>
<p>The prerequisite to employing the Idols Framework is simple. You must be great (top quartile) at two or more skills that you combine to provide unique value to a niche market.</p>
<p>The perfect example is Scott Adams, cartoonist. He combined his skills of 1) drawing 2) comedy and 3) corporate experience to produce the successful &ldquo;Dilbert&rdquo; cartoon series. <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">Here</a> is his take.</p>
<p>Early in life, you will build your skills and also your <strong>margin of safety</strong>. Also called an emergency fund, this is the Buffett slice of the Idols Framework. It provides work flexibility.</p>
<p>Later, use this money to be opportunistic. With it, you can take advantage of major market declines (black swan events). Buy when everyone else is selling.</p>
<p>Next, create a <strong>micro-business</strong>. Walton is the second slice, but not because Walmart is so giant. I choose <a href="https://pod.link/founders/episode/0d9ae711909cea651afe820cb7a9eb00">Walton</a> to emulate because he&rsquo;s claimed he didn&rsquo;t create anything original. Sam Walton learned his best ideas from others. Then, he combined and aligned the ideas with his vision.</p>
<p>I love this fact because it means <em>anyone</em> can start a business. Keep it very small (micro) to maintain sole control. Then, you alone can steer the business to low-stress waters.</p>
<p>Real estate investment makes me anxious. I fear waking from a deep slumber to replace toilets in the middle of the night. But many disagree with me. Small-scale real estate investment also qualifies as a micro-business. In fact, I&rsquo;m advising my son to buy two four-plexes early in life.</p>
<p>At last, the Bogle and Thorpe slices work together to compound your savings. I invest in two Vanguard index funds: 60% in VTI (US) and 40% in VXUS (non-US). These percentages align with the market capitalization of the world stock market.</p>
<p>The Idols Framework&rsquo;s last slice is my <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/">Fast Follow Investor</a> strategy. It replicates <strong>quantitative trend</strong> models built on Ed Thorpe’s early work. The strategy provides deep diversification alongside market-based, passive, <strong>buy &amp; hold indexing</strong> (VTI/ VXUS).</p>
<p>These investment models need no investment expertise. But you must stay diligent. This is easier said than done. In fact, it&rsquo;s the human side of investing that is the most difficult.</p>
<p>One can practice a level-headed temperament with good planning, habit-building, and support. I write a lot about <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/01/30/the-great-one.html">this</a>.</p>
<p>I list the four slices of the Idols framework at 25% each, but percentages do vary for me. And they will for you. In fact, they <em>should</em> flex as you move through life. They will vary based on life stage, the economy, and when opportunities or risks present themselves.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s revisit our <em>wealth created per stress endured</em> measure. We achieve a high score by accumulating <em>enough</em> wealth with very little stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bogle and Thorpe investment models are proven and mindless to use.</li>
<li>With Walton, you stay small (micro!) and navigate your work life as you see fit.</li>
<li>And Buffett&rsquo;s margin of safety provides additional padding&hellip; so you can &ldquo;be greedy when others are fearful&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great wealth with little stress. Magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow the Idols Framework to run a self-directed, micro-business with cash on hand to take advantage of undervalued assets all the while producing high investment returns that are fully diversified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence is long. But, I&rsquo;ll keep this post short. I have so much more to share. Please stay tuned.

<h2 id="my-intended-reader">My Intended Reader</h2>
<p>Simply put, I write <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a> for me. I write for me as someone who is 5 years from finding financial freedom. But, I also write for my younger self&hellip;on lessons I wish I had known earlier. I also write for my future self&hellip;helping me visualize what I want my life to become.</p>
<p>You may not be a 47-year-old, married, father of one who is a management consultant by day and lover of great biographies by night. (P.S. I recommend Ben Franklin, Charlie Munger, and <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html">Ed Thorpe</a>). Still, I hope you find my ramblings helpful as you pursue <em>your</em> well-intentioned life.</p>
<p>Now you know who I&rsquo;m writing for. But, <em>why</em> do I do it? Why do I share personal experiences about wealth building, investing, and living a meaningful life? There are three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing what I learned (or am learning) clarifies my thinking and reinforces lessons.</li>
<li>I hope my son learns from my experiences early and gets a jump on living his best life.</li>
<li>After I die, I wish for future generations to know me and my beliefs. I wish not to be long forgotten.

<h2 id="defining-traits">Defining Traits</h2>
<p>Here is a list of my typical reader&rsquo;s traits and experiences. If you identify with a majority, this blog is for you.</p>
<p><em>Who you are:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You know more about money and investing than the average person.</li>
<li>You know debt is bad, and so you don&rsquo;t have any. That is, except for your home or other real estate.</li>
<li>And, you use credit cards but only for cash back and points.</li>
<li>You have the right insurance on your life, your earnings (long-term disability), and your property. You have added liability coverage (umbrella).</li>
<li>You know high fees are bad and watch for that in your mutual and exchange-traded funds.</li>
<li>You know indexing is good.</li>
<li>You know commissioned investments are bad.</li>
<li>An insurance salesman has burned you early in life. Whole-life, anyone?</li>
<li>You work with a financial advisor, but on a fee-only or assets-under-management arrangement.</li>
<li>You’re <em>not</em> a professional investor nor do you want to be. You don&rsquo;t follow macro-trends, interest rate moves, or credit spreads.</li>
<li>You know the market moves irrationally, and that you cannot predict it in the short-term.</li>
<li>You know that the stock market eventually goes up. At least, it has for the past 40 years!</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t pay for investment newsletters.</li>
<li>Vanguard is your friend. You respect John Bogle.</li>
<li>You find Warren Buffett interesting but don&rsquo;t know who <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html">Edward Thorpe</a> is.</li>
<li>You work hard and may find yourself in a corporate job&hellip;</li>
<li>But you dream of working for yourself&hellip;</li>
<li>And of retiring early, the ultimate form of independence. You&rsquo;ve dabbled in the F.I.R.E movement.</li>
<li>You watch your living expenses but splurge every so often.</li>
<li>You max out your 401k. You invested in a Roth IRA until your salary got too high, and now you wonder if it makes sense to fund a traditional IRA.</li>
<li>You work hard with your head down. Retirement seems pretty far away (though it doesn&rsquo;t have to be).</li>
<li>When you did take a moment to think about retirement, you discovered Required Minimum Distributions. :-(</li>
<li>You were taught &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s too good to be true, it likely is&rdquo; and so are wary of get-rich-quick schemes. But it still would be nice to win the lottery&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Who you want to be:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You want to work in a job you enjoy.</li>
<li>You want less stress.</li>
<li>You want to travel more.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t necessarily seek high pay, but most definitely <em>do</em> seek more wealth.</li>
<li>You desire financial freedom sooner than most, so you can enjoy life&hellip;perhaps doing something different.</li>
<li>To get there faster, you seek out new ways to improve on the great foundation that you&rsquo;ve already built: retirement plan(s), low-cost mutual funds, emergency cash reserve, and possibly even a rental property.</li>
<li>You want to provide the best possible life for yourself and your family.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-this-you">Is This You?</h2>
<p>Do you find yourself in any of these situations?</p>
<ol>
<li>You are unhappy in your current job. Or, you find yourself using financial calculators to estimate how much you need to retire. Whatever the case, you want to <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/24/you-can-live.html">speed up financial independence</a> (a.k.a. retire early).</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve taken the plunge. You&rsquo;re retired. It&rsquo;s more nerve-racking than you anticipated. Without your full-time job, you no longer add to your savings each month. The thought of a stock market <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/11/08/you-not-the.html">drop of 35% freaks you out</a>.</li>
<li>You have recently come into an inheritance. Congratulations! But, you&rsquo;re worried about investing it into a frothy, even bubbly stock market. Should you dollar cost average? <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/23/buy-hold-investing.html">What if the 2020s turn into a lost decade</a>?</li>
<li>Your problem is not financial, but psychological. You no longer have the fortitude to stick with an investing approach. Perhaps, like me, you experienced an investment loss of your own doing (or had a near miss). Your <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/01/30/the-great-one.html">emotions took hold</a> in a way you didn&rsquo;t expect.

<p>Tell me, did any of these resonate with you?</p>
<p><strong>If yes, you, my friend, are my intended reader.</strong></p>

			 <p><em>Ed Thorpe is a mathematical genius, but his approach to life is what most impresses me.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ed Thorpe is a beacon to me. I finished his autobiography last week. He offers a great personal blueprint for living your life. If these highlights inspire you, I urge you to read the entire book. Ed has so much to offer.</p>
<p>I had not known of Ed Thorpe until 2021. He is the first modern mathematician to investigate <em>risk</em> and achieve great financial success doing so. He devised ways to beat the casinos in blackjack and roulette. Later, he used similar techniques to win at investing with his hedge fund, Princeton Newport Partners.</p>
<p>His mathematical perspectives on investments underpin the <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a> investing strategy. And the book details it in a way we can all understand.</p>
<p>But, Ed&rsquo;s approach to life serves up even more lessons.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-All-Markets-Street-Dealer-ebook/dp/B00SEFEYCI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1674765641&amp;sr=8-1">A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market</a>, Ed takes us on his journey from depression-era Chicago to MIT to mafia-controlled Las Vegas and finally Wall Street. Then, suddenly, he casts all of his professional success aside.</p>
<p>At its core, this is a book about how to live your best life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters in life is how you spend your time. Life is like reading a novel or running a marathon. It’s not so much about reaching a goal but rather about the journey itself and the experiences along the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ed learned from Benjamin Franklin (another favorite of mine) who became financially independent at 42 years old. It was Franklin who said:</p>
<p>“Time is the stuff life is made of, and how you spend it makes all the difference.&quot;</p>
<p>Franklin followed his own interests in his next 42 years, and his accomplishments are remarkable.</p>
<p>Ed Thorpe advises that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay independent and in control of our lives</li>
<li>Keep humble</li>
<li>Be great, not grand (Don&rsquo;t get big for big&rsquo;s sake.)</li>
<li>Strive for simplicity</li>
<li>Develop systems for everything in life</li>
</ul>
<p>On investing, Ed believes in finding a simple edge and betting on yourself. At the same time, you must control the size of your bets to cap any losses.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I also believed then, as I do now after more than fifty years as a money manager, that the surest way to get rich is to play only those gambling games or make those investments where I have an edge.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A good defense keeps other people from taking your money. As Warren Buffett said: &lsquo;In order to succeed you must first survive. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the book, Ed clarifies these points with a sports analogy. The very best teams have both a very good offense and a very good defense. Neither has to be the best, but both must be strong to win championships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to close by giving Ed the last words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Princeton Newport Partners closed, Vivian (Ed&rsquo;s wife) and I had money enough for the rest of our lives&hellip;. it freed us to do more of what we enjoyed most: spend time with each other and the family and friends we loved, travel, and pursue our interests.</p>
<p>Taking to heart the lyrics of the song “Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later than You Think),” Vivian and I would make the most of the one thing we could never have enough of—time together. Success on Wall Street was getting the most money. Success for us was having the best life.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, enjoy your life and the people who share it with you, and leave something good of yourself for the generations to follow. &quot;

			 <h2 id="here-is-my-monthly-process">Here is my monthly process</h2>
<p><em>Trigger:</em> At 4PM Eastern, the market closes on the last trading day of the month.</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediately, my FastFollowInvestor.com (FFI) model* identifies those investments to add to or reduce.</li>
<li>At 5PM Eastern, I email my investment changes** to friends and colleagues.</li>
<li>That night, I have a (working) dinner date with my wife. We use a spreadsheet to calculate buy/sell trades in our investment accounts to match the model.***</li>
<li>At 10AM Eastern on the first trading day of the next month, I log into our accounts to buy/sell ETFs as we calculated the night before.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is repeated every month&hellip;forever!</p>
<p>The highlight is definitely dinner with my wife.</p>
<p>But, I should not skip over this fact too quickly. The most difficult part of investing is psychology. How do you stick with it through good times and bad? By tying monthly FFI trades to a dinner date, I&rsquo;m creating a habit that I can commit to for decades.

<h2 id="what-changes-did-i-make-in-february">What changes did I make in February?</h2>
<p>Gold and international equities were winning trades in December and January. The FastFollowInvestor.com model increased both positions in February.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gold is now nearly 40% of my portfolio (up 25%)</li>
<li>International equities stand at 45% (up 10%)</li>
</ul>
<p>February also brings a new allocation to mortgage REITs (up 10% to 10%).</p>
<p>And, after languishing for 3 months, I hold no more commodities (down 10% to 0%).</p>
<p>What remains is very little cash (less than 5%). It is interesting that just 3 months ago, FFI held an 80% cash position!</p>
<p>One thing I love about this system: I must never decide when to move out of cash and into the market. The model does it for me.</p>
<p>See you next month! :-)

<p>*FFI is a deeply diversified portfolio of <em>asset allocation, trend-following models</em> for individual investors.</p>
<p>**Broad-based, liquid ETF indices of stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, and commodities are possible FFI investments.</p>
<p>***I think of these trades as monthly rebalancing into the best-trending investments.</p>

			 <p><em>Economists say humans are rational and emotionless investors. Wrong! Humans are highly emotional, and it hurts our portfolios. The good news is that we can train ourselves to become more levelheaded investors. Take these 3 specific actions&hellip;</em>

<p>On December 9, I shared my <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/01/my-dec-portfolio.html">December 2022 trades</a>. International markets trended up in November. So, at the direction of the Fast Follow Investor (FFI) model, I moved ~50% of my portfolio from cash to international equities. At the time, I was nervous, noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My head and my heart tell me this is a precarious time to &ldquo;get back in&rdquo;. But the market and the model disagree.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“When it comes time to buy and it’s the right time, you will not want to. When it comes time to sell and it’s the right time, you will not want to.”
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Remember: Just like Buy &amp; Hold, Fast Follow trend investing requires fortitude to stick with it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warren Buffett has said: “Success in investing doesn’t correlate with IQ … what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble.”</p>
<p>I agree. Successful investors remain calm when everyone around them is pulling their hair out. A levelheaded temperament helps them stick to the plan. That sounds great. But how, exactly?</p>
<p>There are three things you can do to develop and exploit a calm, levelheaded temperament:</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop your &ldquo;edge&rdquo; by picking the right investment system and knowing it better than anyone else.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Whether in stock selection (Buffett), hedging (Thorpe), real estate investment (any local expert), index funds (Vanguard) or otherwise, choose a system where you know more.</li>
<li>Then, exploit that knowledge by betting on yourself.</li>
<li>For me, this is Fast Follow Investing.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Control your amount of money invested (bet size) so the particular investment system will never wipe you out, even if a black swan event should occur.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Start slow (to go fast) and ramp up your invested savings over time.</li>
<li>Bet more when favorable to do so, and less when unfavorable per the Kelly criterion.</li>
<li>Always keep some of your wealth in cash or U.S. treasury bills. This establishes a margin of safety, as Buffett recommends.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you 1) find your investing edge and improve on it over time, and all the while 2) protect yourself from major losses, you&rsquo;re halfway there.</p>
<p>The hardest part is to put systems in place to stay levelheaded and focused, despite difficult times:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Finally, turn your positive behaviors into habits. Then, investment decisions (according to your preferred system) become automatic.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Tie preferred human behaviors to positive external triggers. E.g., review investments as part of a monthly dinner date with your spouse (no kids!).</li>
<li>Make the impact of not sticking to your habit explicitly known. E.g., project how you&rsquo;d feel if you missed a future opportunity because it would be too difficult to take action now.</li>
<li>Establish social support systems to cheer you on in challenging times.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, I made that December 1st trade into international equities. As a result, my portfolio is up 5% in two months. Of course, international equities could have gone down, and the FFI model would have adjusted accordingly. Up or down, I am happy I was able to stick with the system that gives me my edge.</p>
<p>I will continue to find and meet these challenges each month&hellip;with some months proving more difficult than others.</p>
<p>By reading these posts, you help hold me accountable! Thank you for cheering me on.

			 <p><em>Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) adds strong diversification alongside a Buy &amp; Hold investment strategy. I compare the two strategies and highlight their differences.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In my 20s, I consulted for Accenture out of its Milwaukee office. One highlight of working at a big firm in the late 90s was the sometimes extravagant employee perks.</p>
<p>The greatest perk took place one day in October every year. To reward us for a job well-done, Accenture leadership would rent out Six Flags Great America&hellip; in its entirety. I would always bring my girlfriend (now wife).</p>
<p>Imagine showing up at Six Flags just north of Chicago, parking in the front row, and walking into an empty park. It wasn&rsquo;t as empty as Wally World when the Griswolds visited. But close&hellip;</p>
<p>Our small group would ride Iron Wolf and American Eagle and our favorite, Raging Bull. At times you needn&rsquo;t get off to get back on! One year, I think I went on 50 rides in a day.</p>
<p>My wife and I bonded over our shared love for roller coasters and these incredible days at Great America.</p>
<p>In 2018, twenty years later, she and I were living in the Bay Area. That year, we hired a sitter and drove 30 minutes to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo. We got there early. With excitement, we boarded our first ride.</p>
<p>When we got off, we looked at each other and said, almost in unison, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can do another one.&rdquo; We pushed through it, tried one more, and both nearly lost our breakfast. Dizzying.</p>
<p>The roller coasting chapter of our lives had closed.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="my-investing-roller-coaster">My investing roller coaster</h2>
<p>I felt the same way when watching my 80/20 investment portfolio crash in March 2020. What hadn&rsquo;t bothered me in 2001 and 2008 now did. I could no longer stomach the steep losses.  Why?</p>
<p>I looked at my now greater savings as the collection of 20+ years of hard work. Watching $300K vanish was hard to take. I remember thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just lost 6 years of savings&hellip;6 years of sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At least I didn&rsquo;t pass out like I almost did at Six Flags.</p>
<p>Now, let me fast forward through 18 months when I read everything about investing that I could get my hands on.</p>
<p>I had found an investing strategy to complement my Buy &amp; Hold portfolio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great diversifier, without dilution. Meaning, it enhances my investment returns.  And, best of all, it reduces my risk of severe loss and helps me sleep better at night.</p>
<p>Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA). It&rsquo;s the investing strategy I teach at <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">FastFollowInvestor.com</a>.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="comparing-two-strategies">Comparing two strategies</h2>
<p>To learn TAA, I checked much of what I already knew about investing at the door. Like Adam Grant recommends in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H177WQP/?coliid=I2PL85ONHI4XTC&amp;colid=1S0KE6JUF28QU&amp;psc=0&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im">Think Again</a>, I had to 1) unlearn and 2) relearn.</p>
<p>Take a look at these comparisons I&rsquo;ve drawn:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is a lot here, I know. It took me almost a year to understand TAA. It&rsquo;s new and different. And it doesn&rsquo;t always align with popular beliefs.</p>
<p>So, this is my challenge: <strong>How can I best share this strategy so everyone benefits?</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<h2 id="expanding-the-analogy">Expanding the analogy</h2>
<p>Derek Thompson, one of my <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/plain-english-with-derek-thompson/id1594471023">favorite podcasters</a>, speaks in analogies.</p>
<p>It can help new ideas stick. So let me try one.</p>
<p>I think of Buy &amp; Hold investing like that ride on a roller coaster.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A roller coaster entertains riders with steep climbs and steeper drops.</p>
<p>You must put your trust in the ride because you have no control.</p>
<p>For long stretches, there is a lot of up and down, but you make no vertical progress.</p>
<p>But, riding is easy. You get on the ride and go (think: set it and forget it).
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) is more like a mountain trek.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hiking a mountain takes preparation and, sometimes, training.</p>
<p>You choose your path, and so control your destiny.</p>
<p>While you may need to backtrack, it&rsquo;s minimal if you plan your route well.</p>
<p>When you reach the summit, you&rsquo;re exhausted but feel great given the achievement.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="use-both-for-strong-diversification">Use both for strong diversification</h2>
<p><strong>Buy &amp; Hold and TAA are valid investing strategies.</strong></p>
<p>You can expect positive returns from both. But, one may work better than the other in certain situations.</p>
<p>One obvious use case: the new saver has time to reap rewards from Buy &amp; Hold.  The soon-to-be retiree does not have the time and should tilt her/his portfolio toward TAA.</p>
<p><strong>Buy &amp; Hold and TAA are excellent diversifying strategies.</strong></p>
<p>Together, they reduce your portfolio&rsquo;s overall volatility and don&rsquo;t dilute investment returns. Diversification, not diworsification.</p>
<p>And how fortunate this is! Take a small piece of your Buy &amp; Hold portfolio and try it out. Dipping your toe in the TAA waters is a good way to learn something new and manage risk at the same time.

			 <p>On January 3, my Fast Follow Investor (FFI) model made some portfolio adjustments:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="january-2023-allocations">January 2023 Allocations</h2>
<ul>
<li>~35% International equities (tickers SCZ, VGK)</li>
<li>~25% Gold and commodities (tickers GLD, DBC)</li>
<li>~40% Cash</li>
</ul>
<p>A &ldquo;Santa Rally&rdquo; never materialized, and December was a down month for U.S. equities. The S&amp;P 500 was down over 2.5%. The Nasdaq ended down almost 5%. Fortunately, I held only a 3.3% position in U.S. equities.</p>
<p>The FFI portfolio was up and down all month, closing the month down 0.3%.</p>
<p>Most January portfolio adjustments were minor tweaks.</p>
<p>The most significant change:
FFI&rsquo;s cash position increased by 15% after reducing my investment in one international equity ETF (EFA).
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="my-2022-performance">My 2022 Performance</h2>
<p>For most, 2022 was a difficult (and down) year. It was no different for the Fast Follow Investor portfolio. 2022 ended down 13.1%.</p>
<p>The only good news, if you can call it that, is the standard 60% stock/40% bond portfolio was down 17.6% for 2022.</p>
<p>So, yes, the FFI portfolio fared 26% better. It&rsquo;s nothing to write home about. But, it does reflect the downside risk protection that Tactical Asset Allocation offers.</p>
<p>When the markets do recover, growth will compound from a higher low. This is rewarding over the long term.</p>
<p>And always remember:
The FFI portfolio will never be the top-performing investment strategy in a given year. By design, it cannot be since we wait for an uptrend to buy back in.</p>
<p>Yet, many <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/12/what-is-behind.html">2nd and 3rd place finishes</a> added up make for staggering and consistent success.

			 <p>Today is my birthday!</p>
<p>I am made fun of for broadening its celebration. My birthday becomes my &ldquo;birthday weekend&rdquo;, my &ldquo;birthday week&rdquo;, and even my &ldquo;birthday month&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know why I do this. I just love my birthday.</p>
<p>Birthdays are wonderful days to reflect on your life: What have I accomplished? <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/about/">Who am I now</a>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to tell you about my &ldquo;Marissa Mayer Moment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In July 2012, I was six months into a new job. My first as a director! I was commuting 2.5 hrs per day. Waking up nightly to care for a 1-year-old. I was working hard, but managing it all pretty well&hellip; I thought.</p>
<p>Then Yahoo! named Marissa Mayer its CEO. We were both 37 yrs old.</p>
<p>I looked up her background. Marissa graduated high school in 1993 in Wausau, Wisconsin. This is only 100 miles from where I grew up, in rural Ripon, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>So, in late 1993, we both took off to school&hellip;and now she was the CEO of Yahoo!. It took her only 15 years after college.</p>
<p>It was the first time something shocked me out of the daily corporate grind: What am I doing with my career? What am I working toward? Is this a mid-life crisis?</p>
<p>My wife laughs at me: &ldquo;That was the first time?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy to think that was 10 years ago. In those 10 years, I decided to jump off the corporate track. I have been able to start a couple of (small) businesses and lead a relatively stress-free life. I like it. It fits me.</p>
<p>I google Marissa now and again. I see pics of what looks like a pretty normal life. And maybe we&rsquo;re not so different. I mean, apart from her fame and the $ Millions&hellip; ;-)</p>
<p>P.S. Marissa Mayer- please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. You&rsquo;re awesome!

			 <p><strong>Spend one weekend alone to make plans for a full and well-intentioned life.</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><em>In 2022, I spent a December weekend in Alameda&rsquo;s beautiful Gold Coast neighborhood.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What started during Covid-19 as a need for some &ldquo;me time&rdquo; has become an important, life planning event.</p>
<p>Some do it at the turn of the year. Others do it close to their birthday. My birthday is January 8, so I guess I do both!</p>
<p>I spent a recent December weekend at a local Airbnb reflecting on 2022 and making plans for 2023.</p>
<p>It was an entire weekend for me. An entire weekend not stuck in the daily grind. An entire weekend spent appreciating 2022 and dreaming about 2023.</p>
<p>Think of it as a strategic planning offsite&hellip;for you.</p>
<p>I recommend you do it.</p>
<p>Now in my 3rd year, I have insights.</p>
<p>One insight I didn&rsquo;t expect is how the weekend helps me segment years. Before taking my annual trip, the years ran together.</p>
<p>Now, my life has chapters. The chapters help me fight time which has accelerated as I age. How is my son 11 years old, already?</p>
<p>My second insight tackles how to make the trip&rsquo;s significance stick.</p>
<p>I propose keeping your life&rsquo;s plan for the year simple. I prepare 4-5 goals for the year in a Google doc or in Word. You might even choose to handwrite your plan.</p>
<p>Either way, make a hard copy and display it at your desk. Don&rsquo;t tuck away your life goals for the year!</p>
<p>Please feel free to use my template. I call it my &ldquo;One Year Life Planning Guide&rdquo;. You can access it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10V70q65tnvJjFqbxc9HhVlN_riaXpjYJGokUTQAwNBE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p><em>My life&rsquo;s 46th chapter (2022) started at this humble Airbnb in Forestville, CA.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And one final insight. I find it helpful to create a personal theme for the year. For example, looking back&hellip;</p>
<p>My 2021 theme was <strong>Lay a solid personal financial groundwork.</strong>
This translated to 1) Prepare a wealth plan, 2) Learn to invest better, and 3) Become tax efficient.</p>
<p>My 2022 theme was <strong>Simplify life by targeting the best opportunities.</strong>
This translated to 1) Work on the right things and 2) Keep stress-levels low.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, my theme for 2023 is <strong>Live a full life and try out retirement.</strong>
Our family is making a concerted effort to do new and memorable things. I&rsquo;m going to take some time off work.</p>
<p>Happy planning! Here&rsquo;s to a great 2023!

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with San Franciso, you&rsquo;re familiar with microclimates.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="all-weather-investing-portfolios">All weather investing portfolios</h2>
<p>This analogy has infiltrated investment-speak over the years.</p>
<p>The most direct is Ray Dalio&rsquo;s All Weather investment portfolio (1996).
It holds roughly 30% stocks, 40% long-term bonds, 15% short-term bonds, 7.5% gold, and 7.5% commodities.</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent portfolio (1982) from Harry Browne, holding 25% stocks, 25% long-term bonds, 25% cash, and 25% gold.</li>
<li>Dragon portfolio (2020) from Chris Cole. It holds 20% stocks, 20% long-term bonds, 20% gold, 20% commodity trend, and 20% long volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this post is getting complicated fast for you, do not worry.</p>
<p>I name these investment portfolios for one reason. Smart investors with <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/15/what-eddie-izzard.html">very long investment horizons</a> consider all types of U.S. economies. Or as I will call them: economic regimes.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-four-economic-regimes">What are the four economic regimes?</h2>
<p>Economic regimes depend on two factors that interact: Growth and Inflation.</p>
<p>If we match levels of Growth (positive or negative) with Inflation (yes or no), we arrive at four economic regimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expansion (real): economic growth and no price inflation</li>
<li>Expansion (nominal): economic growth with price inflation</li>
<li>Recession: economic decline and no price inflation</li>
<li>Stagflation: economic decline with price inflation</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessing recent history:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the last ~40 years (1980 to 2021), we&rsquo;ve swung between expansion (real) and recession.</li>
<li>2021/2 included 18 months of expansion (nominal-with inflation).</li>
<li>And, as we look to 2023, we are teetering between continued expansion (nominal) and stagflation.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h2>
<p>Consider these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What type of investments work best in expansionary times? Stocks.</li>
<li>How about in recessions? Bonds.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is good: We have access to stocks and bonds in our 401Ks, IRAs, and brokerage accounts.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What about expansionary times with inflation? Stocks, yes, but also (and more so) commodities!</li>
<li>How about during stagflation? Commodities again. And gold.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This is a problem! Most investors can&rsquo;t access commodities and gold as investments.</strong></p>
<p>Inflation really messes things up. If it sticks around, we need alternatives to stocks and bonds for continued investment success.

<p>In my 20s, I worked for a manager who looked at life through 2x2 matrices. Every situation. Every decision. Everything could be framed by a 2x2.</p>
<p>Well, so can economic regimes.</p>
<p>The four quadrants that define our four economic regimes are defined here:</p>

<h2 id="all-weather-portfolios-make-a-comeback">All Weather portfolios make a comeback</h2>
<p>I mentioned early on that several all-weather portfolios do exist.
But few know about them, for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have been out of favor because they have underperformed. We&rsquo;ve experienced zero inflation in the past 40 years. So, commodities and gold have been a drag on investment returns.</li>
<li>We aren&rsquo;t educated on all-weather portfolios. The mutual fund industry -and the stock/bond funds it touts- has grown massively in the last 40 years. And this aligns with just two of four economic regimes. <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/15/what-eddie-izzard.html">Our own short-term thinking limits us</a>.</li>
<li>Until recently, portfolios with commodities and gold have been hard to set up. Only hedge funds, family offices, and other &ldquo;big money&rdquo; played in these assets.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>Portfolios that accommodate all economic regimes may have been out of favor for 40 years. But, they may soon make a comeback.</p>
<p>2022 and 2023 appear to be years of economic change. It&rsquo;s time to learn more!</p>
<p>And, wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if there was a more fluid all-weather portfolio?</p>
<p>What if you could move money to the best performers when economic regimes changed?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do at <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>.

<p>Eddie Izzard, of stand-up, film, and TV fame, quips that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He grew up in Europe, where the history comes from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like Eddie, I find it difficult for Americans to grasp &ldquo;long-term&rdquo;. We&rsquo;re a young country. Our history is short. It&rsquo;s not a bad thing&hellip; simply a fact.</p>
<p>Later in his bit, Eddie cites a story on TV during a recent hotel stay:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve redecorated this Miami building to how it looked over 50 years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have to see it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6hijsqO8H0">here</a>.

<h2 id="what-is-long-term">What is long-term?</h2>
<p>Is 50 years long-term? Not to the <a href="https://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>From its website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Long Now Foundation is a nonprofit established in 01996 to foster long-term thinking.
Our work encourages imagination at the timescale of civilization — the next and last 10,000 years — a timespan we call the <em>long now</em>.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrast the long now with:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>now</em> (3 days)</li>
<li><em>nowadays</em> (3 decades)</li>
</ul>
<p>I like these definitions. And <em>nowadays</em> is all that the human mind can consider comfortably.</p>
<p>I remember 20 years ago: leaving grad school, getting married, and moving to San Franciso.</p>
<p>I can imagine 10 years from now: my son graduates college, I&rsquo;m working part-time, and traveling in Europe.</p>
<p>Try it yourself. Pushing beyond a 30-year window is difficult.

<h2 id="longest-standing-businesses">Longest standing businesses</h2>
<p>If asked to name a long-standing business, the first that comes to mind for me is General Electric.</p>
<p>GE launched in 1892. It&rsquo;s 130 years old.</p>
<p>Not many make it that long. It&rsquo;s quite impressive, as GE is having its own issues right now.</p>
<p>But, 130 years is nothing.</p>
<p>Staffelter Hof Winery in Krov, Germany opened in 862.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 1,160 years ago!</p>
<p>I find it hard to wrap my head around that. The winery has been around for ~45 generations.</p>
<p>For a list of the oldest business still operating, check out this <a href="https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country/">site</a>.</p>
<p>Of the oldest companies, the industries with the greatest longevity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banking (36)</li>
<li>Alcohol (18)</li>
<li>Postal services (16)</li>
</ul>
<p>Money, drinking, and communication. In that order. That seems about right.

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-investing">What this means for investing</h2>
<p>Experiences from our own adult lifetimes influence how we invest.</p>
<p>Take me. I started investing in 1997, the year I got my first real job.</p>
<p>My biases (good and bad) stem from the period 15 years prior, when the finance books I read were written, through now.</p>
<p>As a whole, 1982-2022 has been a period of strong growth, low inflation, and a helpful Federal Reserve enabling asset growth.</p>
<p>Stocks and bonds have performed well.</p>
<p>But what if I was born 40 years earlier, in 1936?</p>
<p>A look into the more distant past shows a very different situation. Economic depression, war, and high inflation.</p>
<p>What performed well then? Real assets like gold bars, oil, and other commodity products.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="the-key-takeaways">The key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The human mind is challenged to comprehend time beyond <em>nowadays</em> (30 years).</li>
<li>Economic regimes are long (the current one is 40 years) and slow-moving. They trick us into thinking the current one will last forever.</li>
<li>The truth is, we can&rsquo;t predict what investment will always perform well. It&rsquo;s because we can&rsquo;t predict when an economic regime will change.</li>
<li>And a lot of bad things can happen. When you expand your frame of reference to 1,000 or even 10,000 years, &ldquo;once in a lifetime&rdquo;-type events happen all the time.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>As Eddie Izzard points out in jest, we must elongate our thinking.</p>
<p>And we must translate that long-term thinking into how we invest.</p>
<p>A lot of bad things can happen over the course of many lifetimes.</p>
<p>This means we need to weather a lot of tragedy within our investment approach.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fret. In my <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/20/use-this-x.html">next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll share how we can do just that. I&rsquo;ll help you keep your investments performing well throughout your lifetime and beyond.</p>
<p>And the solution is far easier than starting a German winery&hellip; which is good news for those of us who don&rsquo;t live in Germany.

<h2 id="fast-follower-technology">Fast Follower Technology</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;fast follower&rdquo; in the name stems from the technology strategy.</p>
<p>A fast follower is not an innovator.</p>
<p>But when innovation takes off, the fast follower quickly jumps in.</p>
<p>The master of this is Microsoft. Its success speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been in the top 3 in market capitalization for over 20 years.</p>
<p>No other company can match it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Credit <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/largest-companies-from-2000-to-2022/">Visual Capitalist</a></p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal again named Microsoft its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-best-managed-companies-2022-11670630632?mod=Searchresults_pos10&amp;page=1">top-managed firm</a>.</p>
<p>How does it do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have the biggest cloud business (Amazon Web Services) but they are #2 in market share.</li>
<li>It isn&rsquo;t Facebook or Instagram, but Microsoft owns LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Its Xbox is #2 behind Playstation in gaming consoles.</li>
<li>Now, Microsoft is moving into video gaming content with its proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, a fast-follower strategy doesn&rsquo;t work in every situation.</p>
<p>Have you &ldquo;Binged&rdquo; anything online lately? Where is your Zune player? Some misses are inevitable.</p>
<p>But&hellip;a lot of 2nd place finishes, when added up, make for staggering and consistent success.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<h2 id="translated-to-investing">Translated to Investing</h2>
<p>Fast Follow Investing aims to do the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the trend that is working, buy into it, and grow with it.</li>
<li>When the trend becomes unfavorable, get out.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">FastFollowInvestor.com</a> portfolio is never the flashy 1st place finisher.</p>
<p>In fact, it will likely NEVER have the highest return in a given year.</p>
<p>Though stack up many high-place finishes year after year (especially in down years), and you become the winner.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">FastFollowInvestor.com</a> portfolio will be the highest performer over 5 years.

<h2 id="lets-make-this-fun">Let&rsquo;s Make This Fun</h2>
<p>My second reason for the name is that Fast Follow Investor simply sounds better!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a catchier name than &ldquo;Tactical Asset Allocation&rdquo; or &ldquo;TAA&rdquo; (or &ldquo;T&amp;A&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s often misheard.)</p>
<p>In my view, the strategy needs better marketing.</p>
<p>TAA is THE best strategy out there for investment success over the long haul.</p>
<p>Hands down.</p>
<p>But nobody knows about it! And this needs to change.</p>
<p>So maybe a little rebranding will help.

<h2 id="and-that-cute-dog">And That Cute Dog</h2>
<p>Now, for my beloved mascot. The dog featured everywhere is my pup Izzie.</p>
<p>She follows me everywhere.</p>
<p>I think it has to do with her hearing loss in old age. For fear of being left behind, Izzie follows me all around my house. Upstairs. Downstairs. Inside. Outside.</p>
<p>Izzie puts a lot of trust in me to guide her.</p>
<p>And I know those who follow me do as well.</p>
<p>My wife and I have had Izzie since 2007. She&rsquo;s almost 15 1/2 years old. :-(</p>
<p>As my mascot, Izzie gets to stay with us a lot longer.

<p>This month’s trades are in!</p>
<p>On December 1, my Fast Follow Investor model made some big moves:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="december-2022-allocations">December 2022 Allocations</h2>
<ul>
<li>~50% International equities (tickers SCZ, EFA, VGK)</li>

<li>~25% Cash</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;When it comes time to buy and it&rsquo;s the right time, you will not want to.
When it comes time to sell and it&rsquo;s the right time, you will not want to.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember: Just like Buy &amp; Hold, Fast Follow trend investing requires fortitude to stick with it.</p>
<p>One last point:
Notice that last decade&rsquo;s top performers are completely absent: US equities and big tech! Has the tide turned? Only time will tell&hellip;</p>

			 <p><em>Use these quick calculations to determine your savings at a future date&hellip;</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can put away your spreadsheet(s). :-) Instead, jot down your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing savings balance</li>
<li>Investment rate of return (expected)</li>
<li>Long-term inflation rate (estimated)</li>
<li>#years your savings can grow</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll walk you through an example.</p>
<p>In doing so, I&rsquo;ll introduce you to the <strong>Rule of 72</strong>, how to calculate <strong>real rate of return</strong>, how <strong>doubling</strong> simplifies the compounding calculation and <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong> (as a bonus).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll use these values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing savings: $1.75M</li>
<li>Investment rate of return: 12%</li>
<li>Inflation rate: 4%</li>
<li>#years to grow: 45 years
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-72">The Rule of 72</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rule of 72 is a &ldquo;back of the envelope&rdquo; approximation used to estimate the years required to double an amount of money at a given rate of return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rule: 72 / &ldquo;rate of return&rdquo; = &ldquo;# years to double&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Using my #s: 72 / 12 = 6 years to double.</p>
<p>That sounds great. But six years isn&rsquo;t realistic.</p>
<p>We need to adjust the 12% rate, which is a nominal rate.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="calculating-real-rate-of-return">Calculating Real Rate of Return</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The real rate of return is the annual percentage of profit earned on an investment, adjusted for inflation. The real return rate indicates money&rsquo;s actual purchasing power over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nominal means that a dollar now is worth a dollar later (years later)&hellip;</p>
<p>Given the inflation of late, we can understand why this isn&rsquo;t realistic. A dollar six years from now won&rsquo;t buy as much.</p>
<p>So, to account for inflation, we need to use the &ldquo;real&rdquo; rate of return. We take the &ldquo;rate of return&rdquo; from above and subtract the inflation rate.</p>
<p>For nearly 40 years, inflation hovered near 2%. Right now, it is around 8%.</p>
<p>Many experts believe it will settle around 4% over the long term.</p>
<p>72 / (12 nominal rate - 4 inflation rate) or
72 / 8 = 9 years to double.</p>
<p>Therefore&hellip;</p>
<p>The Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) model I follow doubles my money <em>in real purchasing power</em> every 9 years, assuming a 4% inflation rate.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="power-of-the-double">Power of the Double</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The compounded return is the rate of return of an investment over a cumulative series of time. Doubling is a single case of the compound return equation:  An initial investment is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the number of doubles. Such as: $1,000 investment x (2)^5 doubles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m 46 years old, almost 47. I&rsquo;m also an optimist and expect to live to at least 92.</p>
<p>In that case, I expect to get another:</p>
<p>92 - 47 = 45 years of life.</p>
<p>45 / 9 years to double = 5 more doubles.</p>
<p>Starting with savings of $1.75M:</p>
<p>$1.75M x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = $56M in real terms, at age 92.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="pressure-testing-the-outcome">Pressure-Testing the Outcome</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sensitivity analysis determines how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, I&rsquo;ll vary the real rate of return to see its impact on my savings growth.</p>
<p>But first&hellip;</p>
<p>What is absolutely necessary to make the $56M outcome possible?</p>
<ul>
<li>I need at least a 12% annual return (nominal). This is where my Fast Follow Investor.com TAA strategy comes in.</li>
<li>I need at most a 4% long-term inflation rate. I must count on the Federal Reserve to help control this!</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if my 8% real return drops to 6%?</p>
<p>Perhaps my nominal return comes in at 11% with a long-term inflation rate of 5% (11-5 = 6).</p>
<p>Adjusting the real return from 8% to 6% increases a 9-year double to a 12-year double.</p>
<p>45 / 12 = 3.75 doubles.</p>
<p>3.75 doubles reduce my savings at age 92 from $56M to $23.5M.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly less, but I&rsquo;ll still take it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="so-in-summary">So, in Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Investment return minus inflation rate = real return</li>
<li>72 / real return = # years to double</li>
<li>Remaining years of life / # years to double = # of doubles</li>
<li>Existing savings x 2^(# of doubles) gives you your savings target, in real dollars</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing your # of doubles keeps those spreadsheets at bay!

<p>Like many of you, I am fascinated by the collapse of FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. The juicy details will make for a great Netflix series.</p>
<p>But, beyond the high-profile storylines, I have been thinking a lot about how everyone missed this&hellip; including me. Why did I miss this?</p>
<p>I have watched crypto from the sidelines for the last 3 years, often thinking I had missed out.</p>
<p>To console myself, I read about the sketchy characters, the crypto bros, and the money laundering. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not in this.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t ignore Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>He came from traditional finance. He was smart. He (seemingly) supported regulation. He was relatable&hellip;a normal guy. He kept me interested enough to think crypto might be for me.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is human nature to get wrapped up in a one-sided story.</p>
<p>Up until Sunday, Nov 6 these are the headlines associated with Sam.</p>
<ul>
<li>The next Warren Buffett? <em>Fortune</em></li>
<li>The mogul who mastered Washington. <em>Forbes</em></li>
<li>The JP Morgan of crypto. <em>Jim Cramer</em></li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And, since Nov 6, he is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bernie Madoff of crypto</li>
<li>Sam Bankman-Fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative articles are coming fast and furious.</p>
<p>Here is one:

<p>We love heroes, and we love villains.</p>
<p>But, I have to remind myself: the truth exists somewhere in the middle. It always does.</p>
<p>Life is messy.

<p><strong>“If you only hear one side of the story, you have no understanding at all.”</strong><br>

<p>I will try to apply this lesson to my own beliefs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek out counter-arguments</li>
<li>Assess both sides of the story</li>

<p><strong>A related note about Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</strong></p>
<p>This is new. Be open-minded. It will conflict with certain investment beliefs that you may hold.</p>
<p>But also be critical. TAA cannot erase investment risk. The 60/40 buy &amp; hold portfolio doesn&rsquo;t work in inflationary times. TAA falters when markets whipsaw or experience steep intramonth declines.</p>
<p>The result of learning more?</p>

<p>On Nov 13, the Wall Street Journal published</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-retirement-stocks-bonds-market-11668015638?mod=Searchresults_pos1&amp;page=1">The Classic 60-40 Investment Strategy Falls Apart. ‘There’s No Place to Hide.’</a></p>
<p>(the article may be behind a firewall)</p>
<p>My 5 takeaways from the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Market losses impact real people. There is a community in this, and you are not alone.</li>
<li>The article buried the lead: Why isn&rsquo;t 60/40 working? Inflation. What has worked for the last 40 years will likely be different in the future.</li>
<li>Individual investors need a system beyond 60/40 that can adapt to varying economic conditions, not just a disinflationary one.</li>
<li>I disagree with blind commitment from financial advisors to stick with 60/40. We can&rsquo;t know the future. Will it be inflationary or recessionary? Or both? Or neither?!</li>
<li>We are resilient. I would be doing exactly what Johnathan Bowden is doing in his situation. I wish everyone featured in the article good fortune, prosperity, and happiness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Inflation hurts everyone.</p>
<p>And getting it under control must be the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s highest priority.

			 <p><em>Despite popular belief, you need NOT accept market risk.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Last week I <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">shared</a> that Meta would need to double two times over (grow 300%) to recover from its 75% loss in 2022.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about how to better convey the sheer tragedy of this fact.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are two years to retirement.  You&rsquo;re only two years away from &ldquo;hanging it up&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;living the good life&rdquo;. You have $2M in savings and are feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>Then, over the next six months, your investments drops to $500K (75% loss).</p>
<p>How would you feel?</p>
<p>I know how I would. Lots of tears. And then back to work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you&rsquo;re not dumb enough to put $2M of retirement savings in Facebook stock alone. (Neither am I.)</p>
<p>Severe losses, though, aren&rsquo;t limited to individual stocks!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look back at some inopportune years to retire:</p>
<hr>
<p>2008: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis
S&amp;P 500 loss: 57%
Time to recover: 17 months</p>
<p>2000: The Dotcom Bubble
Nasdaq loss: 77%
Time to recover: 15 years</p>
<p>1973: The Oil Crisis and Economic Recession
Market loss: 48%
Time to recover: 21 months</p>
<p>1929: The Worst Crash in History
Dow loss: 89%
Time to recover: 25 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Entire markets can drop 50%+. And the road to recovery can vary: from  17 months (when the Fed gets involved) to 25 years (when it does not).</p>
<p>Significant market drops are normal.</p>
<p>But accepting market risk is not required.</p>
<p>Fast Follow investors cut our losses. In doing so, we manage market risk.

<p>I hope that you&rsquo;ve enjoyed my short series on minimizing loss.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>*Entire markets can drop by 50% or more, setting you way back.</p>
<p>*<a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html">Investment losses</a> are asymmetric and compound exponentially. Losses take a long time to dig out from.

			 <p>This month&rsquo;s trades are in!</p>
<p>In November, my diversified Fast Follower TAA investment model redeployed some cash:</p>
<ul>
<li>13.5% was allocated to the DBC Commodities ETF. Let&rsquo;s see how this trade fares given OPEC&rsquo;s decision to restrict oil drilling and Russia&rsquo;s exit from the Ukraine grain deal.</li>
<li>The model inched into the SPY S&amp;P 500 Index ETF. The S&amp;P gained nearly ~8% in October, but the TAA model isn&rsquo;t convinced we&rsquo;re in a new bull market.</li>

			 <p>This year (as of October 27), six companies together have lost one trillion $$ in market capitalization. They are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta/Facebook.</p>
<p>Meta has <a href="https://twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1585743261054152704?s=20&amp;t=G6_paIdH8iMxmk_EsMKrbA">crashed</a>, losing nearly 75% of its value on the year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Instead of discussing the merits of Facebook&rsquo;s business or how much money it&rsquo;s spending on Second Life 2.0, I&rsquo;d like to highlight the math behind this 75% loss.</p>
<p>The math behind crashes is brutal.</p>
<p>When asked what gain is required to recover from a 75% loss, most people will answer a 75% gain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not correct. The answer is a <em>300% gain</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if you lose $75 of an initial $100, you are left with $25. To recover, you must make $75 back (obviously). But, $75 is 3x your (now) $25 investment or a 300% gain.</p>
<p>Here is another way to look at it:</p>
<p>You must double your money twice over: turn $25 into $50, and then $50 into $100. Using an estimated 10% stock market return, it will take you <em>14.5 years</em> just to break even.</p>
<p>Facebook investors who bought on January 1, 2022 and continue to hold have a long road ahead.</p>
<p>This table shows gains required to recover losses ranging from 5% to 90%. As losses steepen, the pain accelerates.</p>

<p>It makes sense why Warren Buffett&rsquo;s two rules of investing are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Rule #1</strong>: Never lose money. <strong>Rule #2</strong>: Never forget Rule #1.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
-Warren Buffett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Severe losses really set you back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the math of it!

			 <p><em>I guess it&rsquo;s better to learn your lesson early in life, when you have less money at stake&hellip;</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In 1985, I was nine years old and joined my dad for a 45-minute drive to an A&amp;W restaurant in a neighboring town.</p>
<p>The A&amp;W is still there. In fact, I drove through Wautoma, Wisconsin and saw it this summer.</p>
<p>My dad had a business meeting with a man named Vern Taggatz. While the two men spoke, I wasted time in the restaurant parking lot kicking rocks.</p>
<p>My dad was a &ldquo;businessman&rdquo;. He worked for Speed Queen, an appliance company, as a middle manager.</p>
<p>On the side (a side gig!), he and my mom invested in a couple of houses, flipping them. I helped paint. And I stayed out of the way.</p>
<p>At the A&amp;W, my dad was discussing an opportunity to invest in a new apartment complex in Plover, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Little did I know at the time I was part of something that is now all the rage: a commercial real estate syndication.</p>
<p>It took about an hour. Finally, the meeting was over.</p>
<p>On the drive home, I learned that my dad and Vern did the deal.</p>
<p>Years later, I learned that my dad invested about $20,000.</p>
<p>Even more years later, I learned that Vern defrauded my father.</p>
<p>In 1985, several small investors cut checks to Vern Taggatz who ran off with the money.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>My dad was smart. He is still smart.</p>
<p>I try to be like him in many ways. Too much, in fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in management (management consulting). I&rsquo;m entrepreneurial. I love investing.</p>
<p>I bought a high-priced, whole life insurance policy right out of college that I did not need nor could afford.</p>
<p>Double ouch.</p>
<p>The lesson?</p>
<p>When presented with an investment opportunity, really question it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How exactly does it work?</li>
<li>Where is the value?</li>
<li>What is the downside?</li>
<li>How well do I know this person?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the investment opportunity doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> right, it probably isn&rsquo;t!

			 <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting everyone as I create a new community of do-it-yourself investors.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To start, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a husband of 20+ years, father of 10+ years, and management consultant/ business owner.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated with investments and the economy. I have recently become intrigued by purpose and passion.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Why <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>? That&rsquo;s easy&hellip; I&rsquo;m introducing do-it-yourself investors to a personal investment strategy called <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/">Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)</a>.</p>
<p>TAA generates investment returns for you to achieve financial independence. And it protects against losses so you can sleep well in this wonderful, new stage of life.</p>
<p>More DIY investors should know about it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At <a href="https://fastfollowinvestor.com/">fastfollowinvestor.com</a>, I want my posts to show some personality and prove enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>If I do it right, we&rsquo;ll also learn together and have fun doing it.

<p>A little more about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Friends tell me that I&rsquo;m great to watch a comedy with. They laugh at me laughing at the movie.</li>
<li>A storm in New Orleans flooded my car up to the steering wheel. A total loss.</li>
<li>You will want to cook dinner for me because every meal I eat is the best meal I&rsquo;ve ever had.</li>
<li>I love swimming, skiing, and other fun on the lake. My grandparents owned a cabin in Northern Wisconsin, and now my wife and I do too!</li>
<li>My sister competed in the Miss America pageant!</li>
<li>My spirit animal is a dog. I&rsquo;m a dependable and trusted companion, and I always live in the present (both good and bad).</li>
<li>Our terrier, Izzie, is over 15 years old and still escaping from the yard.</li>
<li>One regret I have in life is not traveling for long periods overseas when I was younger. I want to make up for that soon.</li>
<li>Life granted me a great many privileges and only in the last several years have I realized it.</li>
<li>I have been thinking about writing for a long time and now simply must do it. I&rsquo;m very excited to start this adventure with you!
