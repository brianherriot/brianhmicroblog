I don't know why I do this. I just love my birthday. \n\nBirthdays are wonderful days to reflect on your life: What have I accomplished? [Who am I now](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/about/)?\n\nI'd love to tell you about my \"Marissa Mayer Moment\".\n\nIn July 2012, I was six months into a new job. My first as a director! I was commuting 2.5 hrs per day. Waking up nightly to care for a 1-year-old. I was working hard, but managing it all pretty well... I thought.\n\nThen Yahoo! named Marissa Mayer its CEO. We were both 37 yrs old.\n\nI looked up her background. Marissa graduated high school in 1993 in Wausau, Wisconsin. This is only 100 miles from where I grew up, in rural Ripon, Wisconsin.\n\nSo, in late 1993, we both took off to school...and now she was the CEO of Yahoo!. It took her only 15 years after college.\n\nIt was the first time something shocked me out of the daily corporate grind: What am I doing with my career? What am I working toward? Is this a mid-life crisis? \n\nMy wife laughs at me: \"That was the first time?\".\n\nIt's crazy to think that was 10 years ago. In those 10 years, I decided to jump off the corporate track. I have been able to start a couple of (small) businesses and lead a relatively stress-free life. I like it. It fits me.\n\nI google Marissa now and again. I see pics of what looks like a pretty normal life. And maybe we're not so different. I mean, apart from her fame and the $ Millions... ;-)\n\n\nP.S. Marissa Mayer- please don't misunderstand me. You're awesome!\n",

It's not a bad thing... simply a fact.\n\nLater in his bit, Eddie cites a story on TV during a recent hotel stay:\n\n\"We've redecorated this Miami building to how it looked over 50 years ago.\"\n \nYou have to see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6hijsqO8H0).\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## What is long-term?\n\nIs 50 years long-term? Not to the [Long Now Foundation]( https://longnow.org/).\n\nFrom its website: \n\n> The Long Now Foundation is a nonprofit established in 01996 to foster long-term thinking.\n> Our work encourages imagination at the timescale of civilization — the next and last 10,000 years — a timespan we call the _long now_.\n<br>\n\nContrast the long now with:\n\n* _now_ (3 days)\n* _nowadays_ (3 decades)\n\nI like these definitions. And _nowadays_ is all that the human mind can consider comfortably. \n\nI remember 20 years ago: leaving grad school, getting married, and moving to San Franciso.\n\nI can imagine 10 years from now: my son graduates college, I'm working part-time, and traveling in Europe.\n\nTry it yourself. Pushing beyond a 30-year window is difficult.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Longest standing businesses\n\nIf asked to name a long-standing business, the first that comes to mind for me is General Electric. \n\nGE launched in 1892. It's 130 years old. \n\nNot many make it that long. It's quite impressive, as GE is having its own issues right now.\n\nBut, 130 years is nothing.\n\nStaffelter Hof Winery in Krov, Germany opened in 862.\n\nThat's 1,160 years ago! \n\nI find it hard to wrap my head around that. The winery has been around for ~45 generations.\n\nFor a list of the oldest business still operating, check out this [site](https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country/).\n\nOf the oldest companies, the industries with the greatest longevity:\n\n* Banking (36)\n* Alcohol (18)\n* Postal services (16)\n\nMoney, drinking, and communication. In that order. That seems about right.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## What this means for investing \n \nExperiences from our own adult lifetimes influence how we invest.\n\nTake me. I started investing in 1997, the year I got my first real job.\n\nMy biases (good and bad) stem from the period 15 years prior, when the finance books I read were written, through now.\n\nAs a whole, 1982-2022 has been a period of strong growth, low inflation, and a helpful Federal Reserve enabling asset growth.\n\nStocks and bonds have performed well.\n\nBut what if I was born 40 years earlier, in 1936? \n\nA look into the more distant past shows a very different situation. Economic depression, war, and high inflation. \n\nWhat performed well then? Real assets like gold bars, oil, and other commodity products.\n<br>\n<br>\n \n## The key takeaways\n\n* The human mind is challenged to comprehend time beyond _nowadays_ (30 years).\n* Economic regimes are long (the current one is 40 years) and slow-moving. They trick us into thinking the current one will last forever.\n* The truth is, we can't predict what investment will always perform well. It's because we can't predict when an economic regime will change.\n* And a lot of bad things can happen. When you expand your frame of reference to 1,000 or even 10,000 years, \"once in a lifetime\"-type events happen all the time.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nAs Eddie Izzard points out in jest, we must elongate our thinking.\n\nAnd we must translate that long-term thinking into how we invest.\n\nA lot of bad things can happen over the course of many lifetimes. \n\nThis means we need to weather a lot of tragedy within our investment approach.\n\nDon't fret. In my [next post](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/20/use-this-x.html), I'll share how we can do just that. I'll help you keep your investments performing well throughout your lifetime and beyond.\n\nAnd the solution is far easier than starting a German winery... which is good news for those of us who don't live in Germany.\n",

				"content_text": "_I guess it's better to learn your lesson early in life, when you have less money at stake..._\n<br>\n<br>\n\nIn 1985, I was nine years old and joined my dad for a 45-minute drive to an A&W restaurant in a neighboring town. \n\nThe A&W is still there. In fact, I drove through Wautoma, Wisconsin and saw it this summer.\n\nMy dad had a business meeting with a man named Vern Taggatz. While the two men spoke, I wasted time in the restaurant parking lot kicking rocks.\n\nMy dad was a \"businessman\". He worked for Speed Queen, an appliance company, as a middle manager.  \n\nOn the side (a side gig!), he and my mom invested in a couple of houses, flipping them. I helped paint. And I stayed out of the way.\n\nAt the A&W, my dad was discussing an opportunity to invest in a new apartment complex in Plover, Wisconsin. \n\nI thought it was pretty cool. \n\nLittle did I know at the time I was part of something that is now all the rage: a commercial real estate syndication.\n\nIt took about an hour. Finally, the meeting was over. \n\nOn the drive home, I learned that my dad and Vern did the deal. \n\nYears later, I learned that my dad invested about $20,000.\n\nEven more years later, I learned that Vern defrauded my father. \n\nIn 1985, several small investors cut checks to Vern Taggatz who ran off with the money.  \n\nOuch.\n\nMy dad was smart. He is still smart. \n\nI try to be like him in many ways. Too much, in fact.\n\nI'm in management (management consulting). I'm entrepreneurial. I love investing. \n\nI bought a high-priced, whole life insurance policy right out of college that I did not need nor could afford.\n\nDouble ouch.\n\nThe lesson?\n\nWhen presented with an investment opportunity, really question it.  \n\n* How exactly does it work?  \n* Where is the value?  \n* What is the downside?   \n* How well do I know this person?  \n\nIf the investment opportunity doesn't _feel_ right, it probably isn't!\n",
