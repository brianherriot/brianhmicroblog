Have patience! And don&rsquo;t do anything stupid.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Holding cash in your portfolio is the ultimate exercise in patience and levelheaded temperament. It is hard to sit on a mountain of cash when stock (or crypto) investments go up and up in the final years of an expansion. &ldquo;Blow-off tops&rdquo; can run for years!</p>\n<p>Why quietly stare at that gopher hole for so long?\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"my-1997-cash-savings-example\">My 1997 cash savings example</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s explore a scenario at a point in time: 1997, the year I graduated and started working. Imagine we are 7 years after the most recent market correction (October 1990).</p>\n<p>Seven years post-crash, the economy and markets have likely recovered. It is when growth starts getting a little crazy and too much money floods the markets. (It would for another 3 years through 1999.)</p>\n<p>In this example, let&rsquo;s invest $100,000. (This part does <em>not</em> reflect my personal reality in 1997 upon graduating!) A single $100,000 investment keeps the math simpler. Later, I&rsquo;ll show that markets turn south every ~10 years. So, at this point, our investment will grow for 3 years.</p>\n<p>Consider these two cases:</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1: What I <em>did</em> in 1997</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the money into a stock index fund and keep $100,000 invested for 3 years at 8%.</li>\n<li>It grows to $126,000 over 3 years (1999).</li>\n<li>When the market drops 40% (end of 2002), the investment is worth $75,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Case 2: What I <em>could have done</em> in 1997</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sit tight and put $100,000 in a cash savings account, invested for 3 years at 3%.</li>\n<li>It grows to $109,000 over 3 years (1999).</li>\n<li>As the stock market drops, stay put and savings grow to $120,000 (2002).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Case 2, I&rsquo;m up $45,000 over Case 1. In 2003, I move my cash into a stock index fund that is on sale.</p>\n<p>In this example, I&rsquo;m looking backward. You could argue that I&rsquo;m cherry-picking data to prove my point. That is true. But the key point is this: &ldquo;Markets turn south every ~10 years&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>In 2023, a correction could come soon. The stock market has expanded for 15 years! As bubbles form, smart investors set aside more of their portfolio in cash. Cash gives you options, and options are valuable. With cash, you are able to move fast when you find an edge.</p>\n<p>How much cash to stash varies with your specific situation and other investment opportunities. (More on that later.) But, the lesson here is that you should hold <em>some</em>!\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"warren-buffett-is-the-master\">Warren Buffett is the master</h3>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway keeps 10-20% of its investment portfolio in cash. The money is ready when great companies become available to buy at great prices.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Charlie Munger reminds us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the nature of stocks that they go down from time to time.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Cyclical financial crises are in the nature of capitalism.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Random recessions and crashes are programmed in.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, markets <em>will</em> crash. You&rsquo;d be irresponsible not to prepare for it.</p>\n<p>Berkeley Hathaway flips a market crash on its head. It&rsquo;s not horrific, but delightful:</p>\n<p>In 1988, Warren noticed a unique opportunity in Coca-Cola&rsquo;s tragic New Coke experiment. He began to accumulate shares of the beaten-down stock. As of this writing, COKE&rsquo;s stock price is $61. His $1.3 billion stake has grown to $24.2 billion in 27 years. That&rsquo;s an almost 19-fold gain.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another example. Warren swooped in during the 2008 financial crisis. He invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs. In 2011, Goldman Sachs redeemed the shares, earning Berkshire Hathaway a profit of $3.7 billion.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"there-are-many-examples-from-history\">There are many examples from history</h3>\n<p>While Berkshire has perfected this approach, it is not new. The smartest investors learn from history. Here are three more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetty_Green\">Hetty Green</a> was a shrewd and frugal American businesswoman and investor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She amassed great wealth by investing in railroads, real estate, and government bonds. After market crashes, Hetty preyed on low prices, and she became the richest woman in America.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lee_Loomis\">Alfred Lee Loomis</a> was a successful American attorney, investment banker, and scientist who gained prominence during the early-to-mid-20th century. Alfred made several strategic investments in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash. His opportunistic investing helped him grow his wealth during difficult economic times.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Sharp\">Issy Sharp</a> is the 91-year-old founder of the Four Seasons Hotels. Issy developed his edge in the hospitality industry. He used market crashes to invest in luxury hotels and pick up great properties at great prices. Issy capitalized on these opportunities to expand the Four Seasons brand worldwide.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"deals-come-along-more-often-than-you-think\">Deals come along more often than you think</h3>\n<p>Recent history reminds us how often deals come along. We experienced major market drops in 1973, 1987, 2000, 2008, and 2020. That is 5 times in the last 50 years or roughly once every 10 years. Ten years is a long time. This is a true lesson in patience!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2020: The Covid Crash, S&amp;P 500 loss: 34%</li>\n<li>2008: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis, S&amp;P 500 loss: 57%</li>\n<li>2000: The Dotcom Bubble, Nasdaq loss: 77%</li>\n<li>1987: The Black Monday Crash, Market loss: 34%</li>\n<li>1973: The Oil Crisis and Economic Recession, Market loss: 48%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before 1973, crashes were even more frequent. These earlier crashes (known then as &ldquo;financial panics&rdquo;) include the 1929 Crash (and the ensuing Great Depression). The worst crash in history resulted in the Dow Jones index losing 89%.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not going out on a limb to say that we can expect a crash of 30-50% or more, and likely soon.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-earn-the-best-possible-return-while-you-wait\">How to earn the best possible return while you wait</h2>\n<p>There are several places where you can stash your cash. The recent run on Silicon Valley Bank reminds us that every option must be safe and as riskless as possible.</p>\n<p>The options I examine will be either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct investments in short-term U.S. government securities</li>\n<li>Short-term investments backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not messing around here. These cash investments are safe.</p>\n<p>Thus, I&rsquo;ll examine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High yield savings accounts &gt;$250,000 FDIC-insured limit</li>\n<li>Very short-term U.S. treasuries: Treasury bills</li>\n<li>Money market funds holding assets backed by the U.S. government\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"definition-of-best-return\">Definition of &ldquo;best&rdquo; return</h3>\n<p>These 4 criteria combined make up my definition of &ldquo;best&rdquo;.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Safe and riskless</strong> - All cash investments meet this criterion with the U.S. government&rsquo;s backing. The securities have short durations, which means that sudden interest increases do not destroy their value.</li>\n<li><strong>Cheap</strong> - As with all investments, fees reduce the investment return that you earn. The lowest fee option is the best.</li>\n<li><strong>Highest yielding</strong> - When equally safe and riskless, the highest-yielding investment is preferred. Earning interest is <em>not</em> the primary purpose of holding cash, but why not earn the best possible yield?</li>\n<li><strong>Easy to manage</strong> - How difficult is it to keep this money safe? This may not seem important if you&rsquo;re thinking only of keeping a savings account. It will be when we discuss how to buy Treasury bills direct from the U.S. government. It&rsquo;s not easy!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My analysis searches for the optimal combination of 1) net yield (return after fees) and 2) ease of holding and transacting. The U.S. government backs all options and guarantees their safety.</p>\n<p>I will assess various cash savings options first <em>without</em> considering point-in-time investment yields and costs. Then, I <em>will</em> include these details as of April 2023. I share current net yields with Fast Follow Investor community <a href=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me\">members</a>.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"high-yield-savings-accounts-250000\">High-yield savings accounts &gt;$250,000</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the passbook savings account you got as a kid from your hometown bank. Now, we&rsquo;ll make some improvements to it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&rsquo;re older now and have more money. Always open enough accounts so each holds less than the FDIC-insured maximum of $250,000. Most of us have less than $500,000 of savings, so keeping it in two accounts isn&rsquo;t too much hassle.</li>\n<li>Instead of the local bank, use an online bank which has lower operating costs. Online banks pass these savings to you in the form of higher interest rates. Online banking is more convenient too, so this is easy to do.</li>\n<li>Choose the online bank offering the highest yield on savings. This is more difficult. If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ve looked at sites like Bankrate, Nerdwallet, and Investopedia that compare savings rates. But banks are always jockeying for the top spot. To continue earning the most optimal savings yield, you must continually move your savings from bank to bank (to bank)! That&rsquo;s impractical.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>An example:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>MaxMyInterest or <a href=\"https://maxmyinterest.com/\">MAX</a> is a service that rotates customers' savings account balances to maximize yields. <em>Always</em> earning the highest savings yield would be too difficult without such a service.</p>\n<p>With MAX, you set up a series of savings accounts in your name one time. Then, you pay a fee based on cash savings invested for MAX to move your savings to the highest yielding accounts (in amounts less than $250k) each month.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of 18 banks that work with MAX as of this writing:\nAlly Bank, American Express Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, BrioDirect by Webster Bank, Charles Schwab Bank, Citibank, Customers Bank, Discover Bank, Fidelity CMA accounts, First Republic Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, Quontic Bank, Synchrony, UFB Direct, USAA, and Wells Fargo.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><em>My analysis:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nWith a service like MAX, you can realistically earn a high savings rate each month. Its practicality makes me comfortable analyzing it.</p>\n<p>To do so, I&rsquo;ll take the average of the top 5 high-yielding savings accounts for a given month using the list at <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-4770633\">Investopedia</a>. By choosing the top 5, I&rsquo;m making an assumption that while MAX may not achieve the top rate, it will be close. To arrive at a net savings yield, I subtract the fee for the service MAX provides.</p>\n<p>This savings option is easy to use. It requires time up front to establish a series of bank accounts. After that, MAX moves money automatically for you each month. If you&rsquo;re the type of person who likes to optimize your credit cards for points, you could be a fit for this service.</p>\n<p>High-yield savings accounts are a valid option for stashing cash. Later, we&rsquo;ll look at specific, point-in-time yields and fees to help you decide if it&rsquo;s for you.</p>\n<p>Note: Robo-advisors like Betterment, Wealthfront, and Robinhood have a different take on the MAX service. As of this <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-collapse-brokerage-account-deals-632d755e\">writing</a>, Wealthfront brokerage sweeps uninvested cash among 12 partner banks each offering $250,000 in FDIC insurance ($3 million total). The three Robo-advisors offer yields that are ~85% of the top 5 banks' average savings yield. That&rsquo;s pretty good, especially given the convenience.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"short-term-treasuries-t-bills\">Short-term treasuries (T-bills)</h3>\n<p>This option for holding cash is Warren Buffett&rsquo;s favorite. He recommends that the average investor hold cash savings equal to 10% of their portfolio in U.S. Treasury bills.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I find it difficult for the average investor to hold T-bills. There are three ways to do it, and I&rsquo;ll examine each.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h4 id=\"treasurydirectgov\"><strong>TreasuryDirect.gov</strong></h4>\n<p>Individuals can buy T-bills directly from the U.S. Treasury in amounts as low as $100 at TreasuryDirect.gov or by visiting a Federal Reserve Bank. First, you must establish an account online with the U.S. Treasury. It is incredibly tedious, and the site looks like it&rsquo;s from the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>Beyond struggling to navigate the site, purchasing T-bills requires a lot of coordination. You must calculate how much to buy, when T-bills come due, and repeat the process monthly (unless you choose auto-reinvestment for up to 2 years).\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><em>An example:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nThis is what it looks like to access a personal TreasuryDirect account.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>To log in, enter your password by clicking virtual keys on a keyboard viewable on the screen- it&rsquo;s clunky! Then, elect to buy Treasury bills. You can buy bills offered in 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52-week durations. The shorter duration bills (up to 13 weeks) have the lowest interest rate risk and are less likely to decrease in value if rates spike. Select Yes to &ldquo;Schedule Reinvestment&rdquo; to simplify the process.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>My analysis:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nTreasury bill rates are pure since the U.S. Treasury sells them directly. The yields are decent. Fees are zero.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The most significant downside to stashing your cash in this way is the inconvenience of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The buying process is cumbersome.</li>\n<li>Treasury bills can be reinvested for up to two years, but that limits flexibility when transferring or selling.</li>\n<li>T-bills are usually held to maturity when bought this way. Assume an opportunity comes along that requires you to invest quickly. You may not be able to access your TreasuryDirect T-bills fast enough and could miss out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some finer details: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAccording to the TreasuryDirect.gov FAQs: &ldquo;You can transfer any security in TreasuryDirect to an account in the Commercial Book-Entry System. If you hold your security in the Commercial Book-Entry System, contact your broker, dealer, or financial institution or investment advisor. Normally there is a fee for this service.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to dig deeper to find out more. It&rsquo;s too complicated.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h4 id=\"treasuries-via-your-brokerage\"><strong>Treasuries via your brokerage</strong></h4>\n<p>Individuals can also buy Treasury bills within their brokerages (e.g. Vanguard for no fee, or Public.com which charges a small fee). The key improvement over TreasuryDirect is the user experience. Yet, several downsides still exist. And the same complexity exists for selling T-bills before they mature.</p>\n<p>From the Vanguard website: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n&ldquo;Vanguard Brokerage doesn&rsquo;t make a market in Treasury securities.

Treasury bills reach maturity within 1-3 months. So their returns depend primarily on the stated yield (interest rate). The value of the ETF itself can increase or decrease, but not by much.</p>\n<p><em>An example:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nTwo high-performing ETFs are <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf\">SGOV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-1-3-month-t-bill-etf-bil\">BIL</a>. You can buy both inside a brokerage account.</p>\n<p>Why are they great options? Their basic structural factors are sound:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have low fees</li>\n<li>They are liquid and easy to trade</li>\n<li>They minimize trading costs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, the goal here is to be 100% safe. BIL is the largest in the industry, but SGOV is very competitive and growing.</p>\n<p>For a full assessment of both and others, see this <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/dividend-ideas/best-ultra-short-term-bond-etfs\">link</a>.</p>\n<p><em>My analysis:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nThe two best options in this space are indeed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (ticker: SGOV) offered by BlackRock</li>\n<li>The SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (ticker: BIL) offered by State Street Global Advisors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SGOV and BIL buy U.S. Treasury securities which are riskless.</p>\n<p>Yields and fees will vary at specific points in time, so I won&rsquo;t discuss that here. On average, yields are right below the pure yield on Treasury bills. And fees are very low&hellip; like &ldquo;Vanguard bond index fund&rdquo; low.</p>\n<p>Purchasing either ETF via a brokerage account is easy. The funds themselves handle the more tedious purchasing (and selling) of individual lots of Treasury bills auctioned by the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>Also worth mentioning for my Vanguard fans: VUSB is Vanguard ultra-short-term bond ETF. But it invests in investment-grade corporate bonds, not U.S. Treasury bills. I recommend <em>not</em> using it.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"money-markets-backed-by-the-us-government\">Money markets backed by the U.S. government</h3>\n<p>Money market funds aim to keep a $1.00/share value and pay a 7-day yield in line with the short-term Federal interest rate. You can buy money market funds at your brokerage. Some even offer check-writing features.</p>\n<p>A convenient way to own them is via the &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; account inside your brokerage. The sweep account is a money market account that holds excess cash after making other investments. For example, let&rsquo;s assume you have $5,000 available to invest and buy shares in a stock ETF worth $4,960. Your remaining $40 flows to your sweep account, earning interest at the money market rate.</p>\n<p><em>An example:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nIf you invest at Vanguard, you&rsquo;ll recognize that it has replaced its sweep account within the last few years. Its Prime Money Market is now the Federal Money Market (VMFXX). And 99.5% of VMFXX&rsquo;s invested assets are U.S. government-backed. It&rsquo;s very safe!</p>\n<p>Fidelity&rsquo;s sweep account is its Government Cash Reserves (FDRXX) and is also 99.5% guaranteed.</p>\n<p><em>My analysis:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nLet&rsquo;s assess VMFXX and FDRXX. Both are extremely safe and essentially riskless given their federal government backing.</p>\n<p>Yields and fees will vary at specific points in time, so I won&rsquo;t discuss them yet. Like ultra-short-term bond funds, yields are usually right below rates on Treasury bills. And fees are very low, especially Vanguard&rsquo;s VMFXX.</p>\n<p>The big &ldquo;watch out&rdquo; is if you use Schwab for your brokerage. Schwab&rsquo;s sweep account pays much, much less. Schwab&rsquo;s business model relies on earning a spread on customers' sweep accounts. (Vanguard and Fidelity do not. Their business models rely on fees from mutual and exchange-traded funds.)</p>\n<p>Stashing cash in your brokerage account without having to buy a money market fund separately is extremely convenient.</p>\n<p>This assumes that you do not use Schwab as your brokerage. In that case, you could buy a money fund with cash available in your sweep account. It&rsquo;s a bit less convenient. If you must stay in the Schwab ecosystem, I would buy the Schwab Government Money Fund (ticker: SNVXX). If not, the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (ticker: VMFXX) is a better option.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"summary-and-recommendations\">Summary and recommendations</h3>\n<p>All options for stashing cash discussed so far are safe.

It is so easy, you don&rsquo;t even need to think about it.</p>\n<p><em>Very good</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAfter a one-time set-up, optimizing cash holdings across many savings accounts is a very good solution.

Over time, its cash holdings have averaged 10-15%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, a general rule of thumb:\nHold 10-15% of your investment portfolio in cash, on average.

Do this immediately after paying off non-mortgage debts. This is good advice, but for different reasons than often cited.</p>\n<p>Financial advisors recommend putting aside 1-3 months of living expenses into cash savings. Some suggest 3-6 months and others 6-12 months. Its purpose is to &ldquo;give you a cushion to find another job&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>But I look at an emergency fund differently. I&rsquo;m solving for something even more important.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s flip this scenario on its head: A job loss (whether forced or chosen) is not negative. In fact, it can be a huge opportunity. So, how can you position yourself to be ready?</p>\n<p>I recommend saving up to <strong>3 years of living expenses</strong>. Why so much? It&rsquo;s not because it will take you 3 years to get a job. If you read this blog, you are smart and resourceful.</p>\n<p>I recommend extra cash savings for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The savings give you time to find the <em>right</em> job which may take longer than 3 months.  The <em>right</em> job is one that builds the essential skills you need to go into business for yourself. These are skills like sales and marketing, programming, finance, leadership, and management.</li>\n<li>With 3 years' worth saved up, perhaps now is the time to start your micro-business! Don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;ve lost your job in a poor economy. There is no better time to start a business. Difficult times reward only the best ideas, and talent is available and cheap.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>An example:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAssume an individual is early in her investing journey. With a $150,000 portfolio where she spends $60,000 a year, she should continue saving ($30,000 more). Save until reaching $180,000 (3 years of expenses) in cash before investing in retirement and other higher-yielding accounts.</p>\n<p>As shared earlier, this is <em>not</em> what I did in 1997 when starting my career. Instead, I maxed out my 401(k). But, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it that way again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I got lucky by saving during the second 20 years of a 40-year bull market. I got lucky while having no meaningful cash savings cushion.</li>\n<li>Also, retirement savings is slow growth savings. When you are young, you have a chance to hit it big. So, start that micro-business. Maybe it will turn into a big success.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"opportunistic-mountain-of-cash\">Opportunistic mountain of cash</h3>\n<p>This is especially important when <strong>late in your investing journey</strong>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll start this analysis in the same way. <em>Many personal finance pundits recommend</em> staying fully invested. This means holding only enough cash for a small emergency fund. They say that cash savings' low(er) yield is a drag on your investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>Why hold cash when it drags down your return for most of the time you hold it?</p>\n<p>Again, let&rsquo;s flip this scenario on its head. A stock market loss is not a bad thing! It can be a huge opportunity. So, how do you position yourself to take advantage?</p>\n<p>I recommend saving up to 20% of your entire investment portfolio in cash. Why so much?</p>\n<p>I recommend holding extra cash for two reasons:</p>\n<p>#1 - If you are later in your investing journey, you are close to retirement. Holding extra cash reduces the chance you must withdraw from investment accounts when they are down. This is called <em>sequence of returns risk</em>. (Please ignore that confusing term. The term is not important.)</p>\n<p>If you invest alongside the Fast Follow Investor portfolio, any negative drawdown in value will recover within 3 years. Thus, if you can cover 3 years of living expenses and not withdraw from investments, you&rsquo;re set.</p>\n<p>This is especially helpful during the &ldquo;retirement risk zone&rdquo;. The risk zone is the 5 years before and 5 years after your retirement date. If you are heads-down saving and investing, you likely haven&rsquo;t thought about this 10-year span. But, it will make or break your retirement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the 5 years before retirement: Should the market fall, you risk not reaching your savings goal. The solution? Work longer :-(</li>\n<li>In the 5 years after retirement: Should the market fall, you risk withdrawing savings as your balances decline. The solution? Go back to work :-(</li>\n</ul>\n<p>#2 - You can <a href=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/01/30/the-great-one.html\">be greedy when others are fearful</a>. Having cash after markets drop lets you buy wonderful investments on the cheap! Selecting high-performing investments during market downturns is smart.</p>\n<p><em>An example:</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nRemember the individual from the earlier example? Assume she is now further along on her investing journey. With a $2 million portfolio where she spends $120,000 per year, she should save up to $400,000 (20%) in cash. Invest the remaining $1.6 million (80%) of her portfolio in Fast Follow Investor or buy &amp; hold indexed investments.</p>\n<p>This is what I&rsquo;m doing. Apart from the pure financial arguments for doing so, having cash on hand helps me emotionally. I sleep better at night. I&rsquo;ve learned it is really hard to stomach large portfolio swings of tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars as markets move&hellip;and I&rsquo;m a pretty even-keeled guy. I have to think that holding cash will help you too.</p>\n<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t recommend stashing any more than 20% in cash. Greater expected returns are indeed found elsewhere. This argument is absolutely valid. Your wealth growth will lag with a cash position greater than 20%.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h3 id=\"real-world-considerations-drive-exceptions\">Real-world considerations drive exceptions</h3>\n<p>In the earlier example, I recommended holding between $180,000 and $400,000 in cash throughout life. When could it be less?</p>\n<p>While there are no hard and fast rules, I can offer several situations to consider. There is nuance here (as in most areas of life).</p>\n<p>The first two consider <strong>opportunities</strong>. Here, you play offense with your cash.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You spend it to pursue the opportunity you&rsquo;ve been saving for. Then, build your cash savings back up. In the early-stage example, she&rsquo;s saving $180,000 to start a micro-business. Once she hits that milestone, she should go for it!</li>\n<li>Suppose investors have a sour taste for stocks after a severe decline (e.g. the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-9). When markets are undervalued, it is smart to move cash to investments with higher expected returns. In the late-stage example, she could move much of her $400,000 savings into a passive stock index fund. She should certainly do it if the <a href=\"https://www.lynalden.com/shiller-pe-cape-ratio/\">Shiller PE (CAPE) Ratio</a> shows the market is on sale.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next two consider the <strong>insurance</strong> that cash provides. Cash is defensive, but how much insurance do you need?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have passive income that covers some living expenses. Let&rsquo;s say that our early-stage saver generates $80,000 in passive income to help cover $180,000 of expenses over 3 years. In that case, she need only save another $100,000.</li>\n<li>You have access to cash that you might pay interest on in the short term. But it keeps you from withdrawing from investment accounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>401(k) - You can withdraw as much as 50% of your savings, up to $50,000 within a 12-month period. Double it if your spouse has an account.</li>\n<li>Cash value life insurance - I don&rsquo;t recommend you get it. But if you happen to have it, you can borrow against it.</li>\n<li>Home equity line of credit - Be sure to get your credit line in good economic times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are other options too. But I don&rsquo;t recommend credit cards&hellip;the interest you pay is too high.</p>\n<p>In the late-stage example, assume she borrowed $100,000 in total from her 401(k) and her spouse&rsquo;s 401(k). Instead of holding $400,000 in cash, she now needs only $300,000 or a little more to account for interest charges.</p>\n<p>In summary, I recommend holding cash in an amount greater than 3 years of living expenses or 20% of your investment portfolio. Your cash will drop upon pursuing an opportunity where you have an edge. This could be a micro-business or other higher-yielding market investment. You can also get away with holding less if you have access to cash through a 401(k) or cash-value life insurance policy.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"cash-savings-summary\">Cash savings summary</h2>\n<p>We have covered a lot.

Then, at a moment's notice, when the gopher's head surfaces...it pounces! \n\nIn this post, you will learn how holding cash in your investment portfolio creates wealth. Cash savings is a key part of the Idols Framework for wealth building. Cash provides a \"margin of safety\" which keeps you in the investing game. Experts teach you to have a strong defense and build an emergency fund. \n\n>But cash - which to most appears boring, tired, and too low-yielding - is also a stealthy and opportunistic investment.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Main topics covered\n\n* History provides illustrative examples of great wealth built with cash savings. This approach is time-tested.\n* Holding cash is not just for emergencies. Yes, cash provides protection against loss. It also offers purchasing power when great investments \"go on sale\".\n* I analyze several options. Then, I share my favorite places to store cash and thoughts on how much to hold in your portfolio.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Detailed table of contents\n\n1.0 Why keep cash savings? <br>\n       1.1 My 1997 cash savings example <br>\n       1.2 Warren Buffett is the master <br>\n       1.3 More historical examples <br>\n       1.4 Deals come along often <br>\n<br>\n2.0 Earning the best possible return <br> \n       2.1 Defining the term \"best\" <br>\n       2.2 High-yield savings accounts >$250,000 <br>\n       2.3 Short-term treasuries (T-bills)   \n              2.3.1 TreasuryDirect.gov <br> \n              2.3.2 Treasuries via your brokerage<br> \n              2.3.3 Ultra-short-term bond funds <br> \n       2.4 Money markets backed by the U.S. government <br>\n              2.4.1 Sweep accounts <br>\n              2.4.2 Purchased money funds <br>\n       2.5 Summary table with recommendations <br>\n       2.6 Point-in-time analysis: April 2023 <br> \n<br>\n3.0 How much cash to hold?<br>\n       3.1 Emergency fund and more<br>\n       3.2 Opportunistic mountain of cash<br> \n       3.3 Real-world considerations<br> \n<br>\n4.0 Cash savings summary  <br>\n5.0 Related posts \n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Why keep cash savings?\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's wise partner at Berkshire Hathaway, said \"It is not brains but temperament that makes you rich. Have patience! And don't do anything stupid.\"\n\nHolding cash in your portfolio is the ultimate exercise in patience and levelheaded temperament. It is hard to sit on a mountain of cash when stock (or crypto) investments go up and up in the final years of an expansion. \"Blow-off tops\" can run for years!\n\nWhy quietly stare at that gopher hole for so long?\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### My 1997 cash savings example\n\nLet's explore a scenario at a point in time: 1997, the year I graduated and started working. Imagine we are 7 years after the most recent market correction (October 1990). \n\nSeven years post-crash, the economy and markets have likely recovered. It is when growth starts getting a little crazy and too much money floods the markets. (It would for another 3 years through 1999.)\n\nIn this example, let's invest $100,000. (This part does _not_ reflect my personal reality in 1997 upon graduating!) A single $100,000 investment keeps the math simpler. Later, I'll show that markets turn south every ~10 years. So, at this point, our investment will grow for 3 years.\n\nConsider these two cases:\n\n**Case 1: What I _did_ in 1997**\n* Put the money into a stock index fund and keep $100,000 invested for 3 years at 8%.\n* It grows to $126,000 over 3 years (1999).\n* When the market drops 40% (end of 2002), the investment is worth $75,000.\n\n**Case 2: What I _could have done_ in 1997**\n* Sit tight and put $100,000 in a cash savings account, invested for 3 years at 3%.\n* It grows to $109,000 over 3 years (1999).\n* As the stock market drops, stay put and savings grow to $120,000 (2002).\n\nIn Case 2, I'm up $45,000 over Case 1. In 2003, I move my cash into a stock index fund that is on sale.\n\nIn this example, I'm looking backward. You could argue that I'm cherry-picking data to prove my point. That is true. But the key point is this: \"Markets turn south every ~10 years\".\n\nIn 2023, a correction could come soon. The stock market has expanded for 15 years! As bubbles form, smart investors set aside more of their portfolio in cash. Cash gives you options, and options are valuable. With cash, you are able to move fast when you find an edge.\n\nHow much cash to stash varies with your specific situation and other investment opportunities. (More on that later.) But, the lesson here is that you should hold _some_!\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Warren Buffett is the master\n\nBerkshire Hathaway keeps 10-20% of its investment portfolio in cash. The money is ready when great companies become available to buy at great prices.\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/c65fd9f089.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"272\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n\nCharlie Munger reminds us:\n* \"It's in the nature of stocks that they go down from time to time.\" \n* \"Cyclical financial crises are in the nature of capitalism.\" \n* \"Random recessions and crashes are programmed in.\"\n\nIn other words, markets _will_ crash. You'd be irresponsible not to prepare for it. \n\nBerkeley Hathaway flips a market crash on its head. It's not horrific, but delightful:\n\nIn 1988, Warren noticed a unique opportunity in Coca-Cola's tragic New Coke experiment. He began to accumulate shares of the beaten-down stock. As of this writing, COKE's stock price is $61. His $1.3 billion stake has grown to $24.2 billion in 27 years. That's an almost 19-fold gain.\n\nHere's another example. Warren swooped in during the 2008 financial crisis. He invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs. In 2011, Goldman Sachs redeemed the shares, earning Berkshire Hathaway a profit of $3.7 billion. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n### There are many examples from history\n\nWhile Berkshire has perfected this approach, it is not new. The smartest investors learn from history. Here are three more:\n\n* [Hetty Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetty_Green) was a shrewd and frugal American businesswoman and investor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She amassed great wealth by investing in railroads, real estate, and government bonds. After market crashes, Hetty preyed on low prices, and she became the richest woman in America.\n* [Alfred Lee Loomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lee_Loomis) was a successful American attorney, investment banker, and scientist who gained prominence during the early-to-mid-20th century. Alfred made several strategic investments in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash. His opportunistic investing helped him grow his wealth during difficult economic times.\n* [Issy Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Sharp) is the 91-year-old founder of the Four Seasons Hotels. Issy developed his edge in the hospitality industry. He used market crashes to invest in luxury hotels and pick up great properties at great prices. Issy capitalized on these opportunities to expand the Four Seasons brand worldwide.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Deals come along more often than you think\n\nRecent history reminds us how often deals come along. We experienced major market drops in 1973, 1987, 2000, 2008, and 2020. That is 5 times in the last 50 years or roughly once every 10 years. Ten years is a long time. This is a true lesson in patience! \n\n* 2020: The Covid Crash, S&P 500 loss: 34% \n* 2008: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis, S&P 500 loss: 57% \n* 2000: The Dotcom Bubble, Nasdaq loss: 77%\n* 1987: The Black Monday Crash, Market loss: 34%\n* 1973: The Oil Crisis and Economic Recession, Market loss: 48% \n\nBefore 1973, crashes were even more frequent. These earlier crashes (known then as \"financial panics\") include the 1929 Crash (and the ensuing Great Depression). The worst crash in history resulted in the Dow Jones index losing 89%.\n \nI'm not going out on a limb to say that we can expect a crash of 30-50% or more, and likely soon.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## How to earn the best possible return while you wait\n\nThere are several places where you can stash your cash. The recent run on Silicon Valley Bank reminds us that every option must be safe and as riskless as possible. \n\nThe options I examine will be either:\n* Direct investments in short-term U.S. government securities\n* Short-term investments backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government\n\nI'm not messing around here. These cash investments are safe.\n\nThus, I'll examine:\n* High yield savings accounts >$250,000 FDIC-insured limit\n* Very short-term U.S. treasuries: Treasury bills\n* Money market funds holding assets backed by the U.S. government\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Definition of \"best\" return\n\nThese 4 criteria combined make up my definition of \"best\".\n\n1. **Safe and riskless** - All cash investments meet this criterion with the U.S. government's backing. The securities have short durations, which means that sudden interest increases do not destroy their value.\n2. **Cheap** - As with all investments, fees reduce the investment return that you earn. The lowest fee option is the best.\n3. **Highest yielding** - When equally safe and riskless, the highest-yielding investment is preferred. Earning interest is _not_ the primary purpose of holding cash, but why not earn the best possible yield?\n4. **Easy to manage** - How difficult is it to keep this money safe? This may not seem important if you're thinking only of keeping a savings account. It will be when we discuss how to buy Treasury bills direct from the U.S. government. It's not easy!\n\nMy analysis searches for the optimal combination of 1) net yield (return after fees) and 2) ease of holding and transacting. The U.S. government backs all options and guarantees their safety.\n\nI will assess various cash savings options first _without_ considering point-in-time investment yields and costs. Then, I _will_ include these details as of April 2023. I share current net yields with Fast Follow Investor community [members](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me).\n\nLet's get started.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### High-yield savings accounts >$250,000\n\nLet's start with the passbook savings account you got as a kid from your hometown bank. Now, we'll make some improvements to it:\n\n* You're older now and have more money. Always open enough accounts so each holds less than the FDIC-insured maximum of $250,000. Most of us have less than $500,000 of savings, so keeping it in two accounts isn't too much hassle.\n* Instead of the local bank, use an online bank which has lower operating costs. Online banks pass these savings to you in the form of higher interest rates. Online banking is more convenient too, so this is easy to do.\n* Choose the online bank offering the highest yield on savings. This is more difficult. If you're like me, you've looked at sites like Bankrate, Nerdwallet, and Investopedia that compare savings rates. But banks are always jockeying for the top spot. To continue earning the most optimal savings yield, you must continually move your savings from bank to bank (to bank)! That's impractical.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_An example:_ <br>\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/0d0a3a1e13.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"513\" alt=\"\" />\n\nMaxMyInterest or [MAX](https://maxmyinterest.com/) is a service that rotates customers' savings account balances to maximize yields. _Always_ earning the highest savings yield would be too difficult without such a service.\n\nWith MAX, you set up a series of savings accounts in your name one time. Then, you pay a fee based on cash savings invested for MAX to move your savings to the highest yielding accounts (in amounts less than $250k) each month. \n\nHere is a list of 18 banks that work with MAX as of this writing: \nAlly Bank, American Express Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, BrioDirect by Webster Bank, Charles Schwab Bank, Citibank, Customers Bank, Discover Bank, Fidelity CMA accounts, First Republic Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, Quontic Bank, Synchrony, UFB Direct, USAA, and Wells Fargo.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_My analysis:_ <br>\nWith a service like MAX, you can realistically earn a high savings rate each month. Its practicality makes me comfortable analyzing it.\n\nTo do so, I'll take the average of the top 5 high-yielding savings accounts for a given month using the list at [Investopedia]( \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-4770633). By choosing the top 5, I'm making an assumption that while MAX may not achieve the top rate, it will be close. To arrive at a net savings yield, I subtract the fee for the service MAX provides.\n\nThis savings option is easy to use. It requires time up front to establish a series of bank accounts. After that, MAX moves money automatically for you each month. If you're the type of person who likes to optimize your credit cards for points, you could be a fit for this service.\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts are a valid option for stashing cash. Later, we'll look at specific, point-in-time yields and fees to help you decide if it's for you.\n\nNote: Robo-advisors like Betterment, Wealthfront, and Robinhood have a different take on the MAX service. As of this [writing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-collapse-brokerage-account-deals-632d755e), Wealthfront brokerage sweeps uninvested cash among 12 partner banks each offering $250,000 in FDIC insurance ($3 million total). The three Robo-advisors offer yields that are ~85% of the top 5 banks' average savings yield. That's pretty good, especially given the convenience.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Short-term treasuries (T-bills)  \n\nThis option for holding cash is Warren Buffett's favorite. He recommends that the average investor hold cash savings equal to 10% of their portfolio in U.S. Treasury bills. \n\nUnfortunately, I find it difficult for the average investor to hold T-bills. There are three ways to do it, and I'll examine each.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### **TreasuryDirect.gov**\n\nIndividuals can buy T-bills directly from the U.S. Treasury in amounts as low as $100 at TreasuryDirect.gov or by visiting a Federal Reserve Bank. First, you must establish an account online with the U.S. Treasury. It is incredibly tedious, and the site looks like it's from the late 1990s.\n\nBeyond struggling to navigate the site, purchasing T-bills requires a lot of coordination. You must calculate how much to buy, when T-bills come due, and repeat the process monthly (unless you choose auto-reinvestment for up to 2 years).\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_An example:_ <br>\nThis is what it looks like to access a personal TreasuryDirect account. \n<img src=\"uploads/2023/a882454276.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"531\" alt=\"\" />\n\nTo log in, enter your password by clicking virtual keys on a keyboard viewable on the screen- it's clunky! Then, elect to buy Treasury bills. You can buy bills offered in 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52-week durations. The shorter duration bills (up to 13 weeks) have the lowest interest rate risk and are less likely to decrease in value if rates spike. Select Yes to \"Schedule Reinvestment\" to simplify the process.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/fab21dc46e.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"584\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_My analysis:_ <br>\nTreasury bill rates are pure since the U.S. Treasury sells them directly. The yields are decent. Fees are zero.\n\n <img src=\"uploads/2023/774eec3594.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"262\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe most significant downside to stashing your cash in this way is the inconvenience of it.\n\n* The buying process is cumbersome.\n* Treasury bills can be reinvested for up to two years, but that limits flexibility when transferring or selling.\n* T-bills are usually held to maturity when bought this way. Assume an opportunity comes along that requires you to invest quickly. You may not be able to access your TreasuryDirect T-bills fast enough and could miss out.\n\nSome finer details: <br>\nAccording to the TreasuryDirect.gov FAQs: \"You can transfer any security in TreasuryDirect to an account in the Commercial Book-Entry System. If you hold your security in the Commercial Book-Entry System, contact your broker, dealer, or financial institution or investment advisor. Normally there is a fee for this service.\" I couldn't bring myself to dig deeper to find out more. It's too complicated.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### **Treasuries via your brokerage**\n\nIndividuals can also buy Treasury bills within their brokerages (e.g. Vanguard for no fee, or Public.com which charges a small fee). The key improvement over TreasuryDirect is the user experience. Yet, several downsides still exist. And the same complexity exists for selling T-bills before they mature. \n\nFrom the Vanguard website: <br>\n\"Vanguard Brokerage doesn't make a market in Treasury securities. If you wish to sell your Treasury securities prior to maturity, Vanguard Brokerage can provide access to a secondary over-the-counter market.\" Complicated. \n\n_An example:_ <br>\nThis is what you see when you access the \"Trade Bonds & U.S. Treasuries\" section of the Vanguard Brokerage site.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/5a993cd55d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\" />\n\n_My analysis:_ <br>\nThis method is also very safe and nearly risk-free. T-bill rates are pure, so the yield is decent. Fees are zero at best, and minimal at worst.\n\nThe most significant downside continues to be its inconvenience. Your broker's user interface is likely better than TreasuryDirect. But mine (Vanguard) isn't much better!\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding T-bills**\n\nIt is possible to buy an ultra-short-term bond fund to stash your cash.\n\nBuying a low-cost ETF that holds very short-duration bonds is an easy way to own Treasury bills. Treasury bills reach maturity within 1-3 months. So their returns depend primarily on the stated yield (interest rate). The value of the ETF itself can increase or decrease, but not by much.\n\n_An example:_ <br>\nTwo high-performing ETFs are [SGOV](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf) and [BIL](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-1-3-month-t-bill-etf-bil). You can buy both inside a brokerage account.\n\nWhy are they great options? Their basic structural factors are sound:\n* They have low fees\n* They are liquid and easy to trade\n* They minimize trading costs\n\nAgain, the goal here is to be 100% safe. BIL is the largest in the industry, but SGOV is very competitive and growing.\n\nFor a full assessment of both and others, see this [link](https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/dividend-ideas/best-ultra-short-term-bond-etfs).\n\n_My analysis:_ <br>\nThe two best options in this space are indeed:\n* The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (ticker: SGOV) offered by BlackRock\n* The SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (ticker: BIL) offered by State Street Global Advisors\n\nSGOV and BIL buy U.S. Treasury securities which are riskless.\n\nYields and fees will vary at specific points in time, so I won't discuss that here. On average, yields are right below the pure yield on Treasury bills. And fees are very low... like \"Vanguard bond index fund\" low. \n\nPurchasing either ETF via a brokerage account is easy. The funds themselves handle the more tedious purchasing (and selling) of individual lots of Treasury bills auctioned by the U.S. government.\n\nAlso worth mentioning for my Vanguard fans: VUSB is Vanguard ultra-short-term bond ETF. But it invests in investment-grade corporate bonds, not U.S. Treasury bills. I recommend _not_ using it.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Money markets backed by the U.S. government\n\nMoney market funds aim to keep a $1.00/share value and pay a 7-day yield in line with the short-term Federal interest rate. You can buy money market funds at your brokerage. Some even offer check-writing features.\n\nA convenient way to own them is via the \"sweep\" account inside your brokerage. The sweep account is a money market account that holds excess cash after making other investments. For example, let's assume you have $5,000 available to invest and buy shares in a stock ETF worth $4,960. Your remaining $40 flows to your sweep account, earning interest at the money market rate.\n\n_An example:_ <br>\nIf you invest at Vanguard, you'll recognize that it has replaced its sweep account within the last few years. Its Prime Money Market is now the Federal Money Market (VMFXX). And 99.5% of VMFXX's invested assets are U.S. government-backed. It's very safe!\n\nFidelity's sweep account is its Government Cash Reserves (FDRXX) and is also 99.5% guaranteed.\n\n_My analysis:_ <br>\nLet's assess VMFXX and FDRXX. Both are extremely safe and essentially riskless given their federal government backing.\n\nYields and fees will vary at specific points in time, so I won't discuss them yet. Like ultra-short-term bond funds, yields are usually right below rates on Treasury bills. And fees are very low, especially Vanguard's VMFXX.\n\nThe big \"watch out\" is if you use Schwab for your brokerage. Schwab's sweep account pays much, much less. Schwab's business model relies on earning a spread on customers' sweep accounts. (Vanguard and Fidelity do not. Their business models rely on fees from mutual and exchange-traded funds.) \n\nStashing cash in your brokerage account without having to buy a money market fund separately is extremely convenient.\n\nThis assumes that you do not use Schwab as your brokerage. In that case, you could buy a money fund with cash available in your sweep account. It's a bit less convenient. If you must stay in the Schwab ecosystem, I would buy the Schwab Government Money Fund (ticker: SNVXX). If not, the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (ticker: VMFXX) is a better option.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Summary and recommendations\n\nAll options for stashing cash discussed so far are safe. To pick the best solution, look at net yield and ease of managing the account. Individual situations (e.g. the institution that holds your brokerage account) also play a factor.\n \nHere is a summary and also my recommendations.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/aef4567975.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"146\" alt=\"\" />\n\n**Strong choices:** <br>\n\n *Best*  <br>\nA money market sweep account is the absolute easiest way to earn a very safe, near-riskless, strongly competitive net yield on your cash. It works best for those using Vanguard's brokerage. It's pretty darn good for those with a Fidelity brokerage account. It is so easy, you don't even need to think about it.\n\n*Very good* <br>\nAfter a one-time set-up, optimizing cash holdings across many savings accounts is a very good solution. This works best if you're the type of person who likes optimizing your use of credit cards for points. If you are, you should investigate [MaxMyInterest](https://maxmyinterest.com). \n\n*Very good* <br>\nTwo other good choices are buying:\n* The highest-yielding (net) money market fund\n* An ultra-short-term bond fund holding government securities\n\nBoth require a bit more work. You should look across products to understand net savings yields at specific points in time. To make it easy, I do this for members of the Fast Follow Investor community. If you're interested, you can sign up [here](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me). This solution works best if you cannot drop Charles Schwab as your brokerage. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Point-in-time analysis: April 2023\n\nHere is a summary of net interest yields as of April 5, 2023. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/7ac0ff3ded.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"202\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe highest-yielding cash investments (after fees) are:\n* Top high-yield savings accounts\n* Treasury bills, themselves\n* Vanguard's Federal Money Market Fund\nHighlighted in green, each is averaging ~4.6% net yield.\n\nThe worst yield is Schwab's sweep account. Schwab's \"uninvested cash in your brokerage or retirement accounts\" yields 0.45% net interest.\n\nWhen choosing your optimal cash savings solution, always consider: \n* Current net yields \n* The ease of managing your cash savings\n* Your personal situation, like where you maintain your brokerage\n<br>\n<br>\n\nLinks to cash investment product research:\n\n* [High-yield savings](https://www.investopedia.com/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-4770633)\n* [Treasury bills](https://www.bankrate.com/rates/interest-rates/91-day-treasury-bill/)\n* [SGOV ultra-short ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/ishares-0-3-month-treasury-bond-etf)\n* [BIL ultra-short ETF](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-1-3-month-t-bill-etf-bil)\n* [VMFXX money market](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx)\n* [FDRXX money market](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316067107)\n* [Uninvested cash (Schwab)](https://www.schwab.com/cash-investments)\n* [SNVXX money market](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/snvxx)\n\nAnd always remember: this analysis is in no way financial advice. It's financial education.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Determining how much cash to hold\n\nBefore diving in, let's take stock of what we know.\n\n1. Cash provides a great cushion in bad times. It helps us be opportunistic when investments go on sale after a market loss.\n2. Many great investors have used cash to take advantage of turbulent times in U.S. markets. We should too.\n3. There are many places to hold your cash. The most convenient and highest yielding (net) are:\n* Brokerage sweep accounts (not Charles Schwab)\n* Other low-cost money market funds\n* Ultra-short-term bond funds that hold Treasury bills\n\nSo, now: How much cash should we hold?\n\n_The short answer:_ <br>\nIt depends on your personal situation and what opportunities exist to earn better returns.\n\n_A better answer:_ <br>\nHow about a general rule gleaned from the greatest investor of all time?\n\n* Warren Buffett recommends that investors hold 10% of their portfolios in safe, short-term Treasury bills or \"cash\".\n* Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway holds up to 20% of its investment portfolio in cash. Over time, its cash holdings have averaged 10-15%.\n\nSo, a general rule of thumb:\nHold 10-15% of your investment portfolio in cash, on average. Hold up to 20% when markets become overheated.\n\n_The best answer:_ <br>\nA detailed analysis can be conducted at certain points in your investing journey.\n\n* First, we'll examine someone starting out (small investment portfolio).\n* Then, we'll examine someone late in their investing journey (large investment portfolio).\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Emergency fund and more\n\nThis is especially important when **early in your investing journey**.\n\nMany personal finance pundits recommend building an emergency fund. Do this immediately after paying off non-mortgage debts. This is good advice, but for different reasons than often cited.\n\nFinancial advisors recommend putting aside 1-3 months of living expenses into cash savings. Some suggest 3-6 months and others 6-12 months. Its purpose is to \"give you a cushion to find another job\".\n\nBut I look at an emergency fund differently. I'm solving for something even more important.\n\nLet's flip this scenario on its head: A job loss (whether forced or chosen) is not negative. In fact, it can be a huge opportunity. So, how can you position yourself to be ready?\n\nI recommend saving up to **3 years of living expenses**. Why so much? It's not because it will take you 3 years to get a job. If you read this blog, you are smart and resourceful. \n\nI recommend extra cash savings for two reasons:\n\n1. The savings give you time to find the _right_ job which may take longer than 3 months.  The _right_ job is one that builds the essential skills you need to go into business for yourself. These are skills like sales and marketing, programming, finance, leadership, and management.\n2. With 3 years' worth saved up, perhaps now is the time to start your micro-business! Don't worry if you've lost your job in a poor economy. There is no better time to start a business. Difficult times reward only the best ideas, and talent is available and cheap.\n\n_An example:_ <br>\nAssume an individual is early in her investing journey. With a $150,000 portfolio where she spends $60,000 a year, she should continue saving ($30,000 more). Save until reaching $180,000 (3 years of expenses) in cash before investing in retirement and other higher-yielding accounts.\n\nAs shared earlier, this is _not_ what I did in 1997 when starting my career. Instead, I maxed out my 401(k). But, I wouldn't do it that way again. \n\n* I got lucky by saving during the second 20 years of a 40-year bull market. I got lucky while having no meaningful cash savings cushion.\n* Also, retirement savings is slow growth savings. When you are young, you have a chance to hit it big. So, start that micro-business. Maybe it will turn into a big success.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Opportunistic mountain of cash  \n\nThis is especially important when **late in your investing journey**.\n\nI'll start this analysis in the same way. _Many personal finance pundits recommend_ staying fully invested. This means holding only enough cash for a small emergency fund. They say that cash savings' low(er) yield is a drag on your investment portfolio.\n\nWhy hold cash when it drags down your return for most of the time you hold it?\n\nAgain, let's flip this scenario on its head. A stock market loss is not a bad thing! It can be a huge opportunity. So, how do you position yourself to take advantage?\n\nI recommend saving up to 20% of your entire investment portfolio in cash. Why so much?\n\nI recommend holding extra cash for two reasons:\n\n#1 - If you are later in your investing journey, you are close to retirement. Holding extra cash reduces the chance you must withdraw from investment accounts when they are down. This is called _sequence of returns risk_. (Please ignore that confusing term. The term is not important.)\n\nIf you invest alongside the Fast Follow Investor portfolio, any negative drawdown in value will recover within 3 years. Thus, if you can cover 3 years of living expenses and not withdraw from investments, you're set. \n\nThis is especially helpful during the \"retirement risk zone\". The risk zone is the 5 years before and 5 years after your retirement date. If you are heads-down saving and investing, you likely haven't thought about this 10-year span. But, it will make or break your retirement. \n\n* In the 5 years before retirement: Should the market fall, you risk not reaching your savings goal. The solution? Work longer :-(  \n* In the 5 years after retirement: Should the market fall, you risk withdrawing savings as your balances decline. The solution? Go back to work :-(\n\n#2 - You can [be greedy when others are fearful](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/01/30/the-great-one.html). Having cash after markets drop lets you buy wonderful investments on the cheap! Selecting high-performing investments during market downturns is smart.\n\n_An example:_ <br>\nRemember the individual from the earlier example? Assume she is now further along on her investing journey. With a $2 million portfolio where she spends $120,000 per year, she should save up to $400,000 (20%) in cash. Invest the remaining $1.6 million (80%) of her portfolio in Fast Follow Investor or buy & hold indexed investments.\n\nThis is what I'm doing. Apart from the pure financial arguments for doing so, having cash on hand helps me emotionally. I sleep better at night. I've learned it is really hard to stomach large portfolio swings of tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars as markets move...and I'm a pretty even-keeled guy. I have to think that holding cash will help you too.\n\nThat said, I don't recommend stashing any more than 20% in cash. Greater expected returns are indeed found elsewhere. This argument is absolutely valid. Your wealth growth will lag with a cash position greater than 20%. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Real-world considerations drive exceptions\n\nIn the earlier example, I recommended holding between $180,000 and $400,000 in cash throughout life. When could it be less?\n\nWhile there are no hard and fast rules, I can offer several situations to consider. There is nuance here (as in most areas of life).\n\nThe first two consider **opportunities**. Here, you play offense with your cash.\n\n1. You spend it to pursue the opportunity you've been saving for. Then, build your cash savings back up. In the early-stage example, she's saving $180,000 to start a micro-business. Once she hits that milestone, she should go for it!\n2. Suppose investors have a sour taste for stocks after a severe decline (e.g. the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-9). When markets are undervalued, it is smart to move cash to investments with higher expected returns. In the late-stage example, she could move much of her $400,000 savings into a passive stock index fund. She should certainly do it if the [Shiller PE (CAPE) Ratio](https://www.lynalden.com/shiller-pe-cape-ratio/) shows the market is on sale.\n\nThe next two consider the **insurance** that cash provides. Cash is defensive, but how much insurance do you need?\n\n1. You have passive income that covers some living expenses. Let's say that our early-stage saver generates $80,000 in passive income to help cover $180,000 of expenses over 3 years. In that case, she need only save another $100,000.\n2. You have access to cash that you might pay interest on in the short term. But it keeps you from withdrawing from investment accounts. \n\nSome examples are:\n* 401(k) - You can withdraw as much as 50% of your savings, up to $50,000 within a 12-month period. Double it if your spouse has an account.\n* Cash value life insurance - I don't recommend you get it. But if you happen to have it, you can borrow against it.\n* Home equity line of credit - Be sure to get your credit line in good economic times.\n\nThere are other options too. But I don't recommend credit cards...the interest you pay is too high. \n\nIn the late-stage example, assume she borrowed $100,000 in total from her 401(k) and her spouse's 401(k). Instead of holding $400,000 in cash, she now needs only $300,000 or a little more to account for interest charges.\n\nIn summary, I recommend holding cash in an amount greater than 3 years of living expenses or 20% of your investment portfolio. Your cash will drop upon pursuing an opportunity where you have an edge. This could be a micro-business or other higher-yielding market investment. You can also get away with holding less if you have access to cash through a 401(k) or cash-value life insurance policy.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Cash savings summary\n\nWe have covered a lot. And now you know the importance of cash savings when ascribing to the Idols Framework for building wealth.\n\n* Cash is defensive _and_ opportunistic.\n* Historically, it's generated huge wealth in turbulent economic times. \n* It has never been easier to generate great returns using high-yield savings accounts, ultra-short-term bond funds, and money markets funds. If you have the right brokerage, your sweep account handles it automatically. \n* And we optimized how much cash to hold given the stage of your investing journey.\n\nCash is king! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Related posts \n\nRead more about the Idols Framework for wealth creation.\n* [Idols Framework overview](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/13/this-is-my.html)\n* [Part 1: Cash savings and margin of safety](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/04/09/cash-its-no.html)\n* [Part 2: Starting a micro-business](https://fastfollowinvestor.com)\n* [Part 3: Buy & hold index investing](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/04/07/buy-hold-investing.html)\n* [Part 4: Fast Follow Investing gives you control](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/23/buy-hold-investing.html)\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Tweet</a><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://platform.linkedin.com/in.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">lang: en_US</script>\n<script type=\"IN/Share\" data-url=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/04/09/cash-its-no.html\"></script>\nSubscribe to get my posts sent to your Inbox.

Very wrong.</p>\n<p>Suze is misinforming those of us working hard to achieve financial independence.</p>\n<p>In this post, I will show you how to <strong>shave $3.4 Million off this misguided $5 Million savings target</strong>. All you must do is 1) Review your large expenses, 2) Turn your hobby into a micro-business, and 3) Invest smarter.</p>\n<p>Before we dive in, think about this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;How much longer would you need to work to save an additional $3.4 Million dollars?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope the answer is &ldquo;far too long to even consider it!&rdquo;. In fact, it&rsquo;s likely not even possible for most of us.</p>\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s clarify a <em>$5 Million retirement</em>.</p>\n<p>The often-used <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-the-4-percent-retirement-savings-rule/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%204%25%20rule%20for%20retirement%3F,for%20inflation%20each%20subsequent%20year.\">4% rule</a> translates $5 Million of retirement savings to living on $200,000 annually for 30 years. (More on this 30-year timeframe, later).</p>\n<p>Next, we can reduce this $5 Million savings target by ~70% using three strategies.</p>\n<p>To do so, we&rsquo;ll build a case to adjust needing $200,000 annually. Then, we&rsquo;ll <em>back into</em> the reduced savings target. And, we&rsquo;ll do this all without sacrificing quality of life in retirement.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"1-investigate-large-expenses-to-reduce-spending\">#1: Investigate large expenses to reduce spending</h2>\n<p>What is the best way to reduce the income needed in retirement? The best way is the most direct way: eliminate unnecessary living expenses.</p>\n<p>Please take note! This is not an act of frugality or meant to reduce your quality of life in retirement. I&rsquo;m willing to bet that you can comfortably live on 20% less. Let&rsquo;s shave off $40,000 in spending without feeling it.</p>\n<p><em>Exercise #1:</em>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nLook at your annual expenses and do the necessary work to curb your spending. Start with the big expenses: home, car, and health. Can you refinance your mortgage? How about selling a car and biking instead? Have you signed up for a subsidized Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plan at healthcare.gov?</p>\n<p><em>Exericise #2:</em>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nImagine you are an entrepreneur, and it is &ldquo;Day 1&rdquo;. Assume that you can only afford 25% of what you had planned for. In this scenario, your $200,000 annual spend becomes $50,000. What unique changes can you make? This exercise results in extreme ideas that you could later change to be less severe.</p>\n<p><em>Exercise #3:</em>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nLearn from others who have come before you. Here are 10 ideas that members of the Fast Follow Investor community have shared with me. You need NOT downsize your home, reduce the # of vacations you take, or eliminate a daily coffee habit!</p>\n<p>Instead, you might:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cancel subscriptions that you no longer use - save $1,000 each year</li>\n<li>Eliminate or reduce insurance premiums (life, long-term disability, auto) - $10,000</li>\n<li>Read/listen to books using Libby instead of purchasing on Amazon - $1,000</li>\n<li>Program your thermostat and lower the temperature on your water heater - $3,000</li>\n<li>Ask for coupon codes via a company website&rsquo;s chatbot before buying online - $1,000</li>\n<li>Transition to one car and save on maintenance, licensing, and insurance - $6,000</li>\n<li>Switch to a subsidized healthcare plan through healthcare.gov - $10,000</li>\n<li>Refinance your mortgage - $3,000</li>\n<li>Stop supporting your kids (cell phone bills, bank overdraft fees). They are adults now. - $1,000</li>\n<li>Commit to &ldquo;wait one week to buy&rdquo; after placing an item in your Amazon shopping cart - $4,000</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Total annual savings: $40,000</p>\n<p>And don&rsquo;t fret about inflation. Even with inflation, <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/age-banding-by-basu-to-model-retirement-spending-needs-by-category/\">studies</a> show that the average retiree&rsquo;s spending drops by 25% for every 10 years in retirement. If you retire early, you should adjust that assumption. But, in case you don&rsquo;t believe me: think about how much your 85-year-old mother spends on travel, for example. Spending <em>in real terms</em> declines as you age.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><em>Calculation:</em>\n($200K less $40K saved = $160K needed)/4% = $4M savings target, updated.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>With reduced spending, we are now living a $5 Million retirement on $4 Million in savings.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s $1 Million less savings required! How many fewer years of work is that? 10 years? More?</p>\n<p>But we can do better&hellip;\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"2-you-will-want-to-stay-busy-so-get-paid-for-it\">#2: You will want to stay busy, so get paid for it.</h2>\n<p>Any income earned in retirement is that much less you need to save!</p>\n<p>I often hear this concern: &ldquo;But wait, if I&rsquo;m working then I&rsquo;m not retired.&rdquo; Yes and no. It depends on how you&rsquo;re earning this retirement income. Also, after relaxing in retirement for a while, you may realize you need some purpose back in your life. Earning money <em>on your terms this time</em> is a way to get it. For example, why not work a few half days at a local cafe? It&rsquo;s a great way to stay connected with friends and the community.</p>\n<p>My grandfather and my father-in-law both worked in retirement for reasons beyond money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My grandpa Kenny&rsquo;s career as a plumber lead him to work as a sales associate at his local Ace Hardware. Before taking the job, he confided in me about his boredom: &ldquo;Brian, I can only rotate the wheels on the vacuum cleaner so many times.&rdquo; At Ace Hardware, he helped customers find what they needed. But mostly, he loved chatting with them. My grandpa was an expert joke teller.</li>\n<li>My father-in-law, Robin&rsquo;s situation was similar. He loves golf. Robin works several days a week now as a starter at his favorite golf course. He jokes with the golfing regulars all day. He spins his yarns. And he gets a paycheck. And free golf!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can think of several options for making money when retired.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rent out that extra room in your basement. Or, if you travel for part of the year, rent out your house during that time.</li>\n<li>While very few kickback permanently in retirement, it&rsquo;s especially true of early retirees. Those quicker to find financial independence are especially likely to pick up a new job or career.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you like people? Work part-time at your favorite coffee house.</li>\n<li>Do you like books? Work at the library.</li>\n<li>Are you fortunate enough to have seasonal skills? A retired accountant could pick up work during the busy tax season, then be off in time for the summer.</li>\n<li>Do you like your former colleagues? You could consult with your former employer for part of the year.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Perhaps you have a hobby or passion project. Find <a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\">1,000 true fans</a> and watch the money roll in. My uncle-in-law, Howard, is the foremost expert on Mazda RX-7 and RX-8 cars. He&rsquo;s an absolute true fan of the Rotary engine. And he&rsquo;s an expert. Each year, Mazda RX fans spend oodles of time and money working with Howard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The options are endless.</p>\n<p>Here are a few opportunities that add up to $80,000 per year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put your house on Airbnb or VRBO. Rent it out during an extended trip you take to earn $10,000.</li>\n<li>Do seasonal work or part-time consulting. Charge $15,000 for each of the 3 months and earn $45,000.</li>\n<li>Monetize a hobby or passion. Sell $250 worth of <em>something</em> to 100 true fans to earn $25,000.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Calculation:</em>\n($160K less $80K earned = $80K needed)/4% = $2M savings target, updated.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>With some income in retirement, we are now living a $5 Million retirement on $2 Million in savings.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s another $2 Million less savings required! Wow. Let&rsquo;s find more&hellip;\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"3-maximize-the-withdrawal-rate-on-your-savings\">#3: Maximize the withdrawal rate on your savings</h2>\n<p>The final strategy is the easiest to implement. You need <em>not</em> cut spending or monetize hobbies. Instead, just invest your nest egg smarter.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit the 4% rule that I used earlier. The rule first appeared in 1994 after studying a 60%-40% U.S. stock-to-bond portfolio over different 30 years periods in history. But, using a 4% safe withdrawal rate (SWR) is inaccurate for two important reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is based on an inferior investment strategy (60/40). You can invest for greater return and less risk.</li>\n<li>It is timebound to 30 years. What if you want to stay retired for 35 years? 50 years? Or longer?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s use 5% as the corrected, perpetual withdrawal rate (PWR). To do so, the Fast Follow Investor strategy is necessary. I break it down further in this [post](to update with SWR/PWR post).</p>\n<p>So, our $80,000 annual income in retirement no longer requires $2 Million in savings.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><em>Calculation:</em>\n$80K needed/updated 5% withdrawal rate = $1.6M savings target, updated.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>This is $400,000 less savings required.</p>\n<p>In total, the three strategies reduced our retirement savings required by $3.4 Million.</p>\n<p>So there you have it: with a little work, your $5 Million nest egg need only be $1.6 Million!</p>\n<p>$1.6 Million still requires work to build. To do it, I urge you to follow the <a href=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/13/this-is-my.html\">Idols Framework</a> for smarter wealth creation. But it is calming to know you needn&rsquo;t stay in your job decades longer to save an <em>unnecessary</em>, extra $3.4 Million.</p>\n<p>Please, do this analysis for yourselves!</p>\n<p>I suspect many of you reading this are financially independent NOW. But, you may not have realized it. Make the jump. Take the plunge.

				"content_text": "_Use these 3 strategies to shave 70% off your supposed retirement savings._\n<br>\n<br>\n\nYour retirement savings target (your \"number\") is less than you think you need.\n\nIn 2019, personal finance guru Suze Orman announced you need [$5 Million to live a happy retirement](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-you-need-to-retire-early-retirement_l_5c4790a9e4b0b6693674d32d).\n\nThat's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Very wrong.\n\nSuze is misinforming those of us working hard to achieve financial independence.\n\nIn this post, I will show you how to **shave $3.4 Million off this misguided $5 Million savings target**. All you must do is 1) Review your large expenses, 2) Turn your hobby into a micro-business, and 3) Invest smarter.\n\nBefore we dive in, think about this: \n> \"How much longer would you need to work to save an additional $3.4 Million dollars?\"\n\nI hope the answer is \"far too long to even consider it!\". In fact, it's likely not even possible for most of us.\n\nFirst, let's clarify a _$5 Million retirement_.\n\nThe often-used [4% rule](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-the-4-percent-retirement-savings-rule/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%204%25%20rule%20for%20retirement%3F,for%20inflation%20each%20subsequent%20year.) translates $5 Million of retirement savings to living on $200,000 annually for 30 years. (More on this 30-year timeframe, later).\n\nNext, we can reduce this $5 Million savings target by ~70% using three strategies. \n\nTo do so, we'll build a case to adjust needing $200,000 annually. Then, we'll _back into_ the reduced savings target. And, we'll do this all without sacrificing quality of life in retirement.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## #1: Investigate large expenses to reduce spending\n\nWhat is the best way to reduce the income needed in retirement? The best way is the most direct way: eliminate unnecessary living expenses. \n\nPlease take note! This is not an act of frugality or meant to reduce your quality of life in retirement. I'm willing to bet that you can comfortably live on 20% less. Let's shave off $40,000 in spending without feeling it.   \n\n_Exercise #1:_\n<br>\nLook at your annual expenses and do the necessary work to curb your spending. Start with the big expenses: home, car, and health. Can you refinance your mortgage? How about selling a car and biking instead? Have you signed up for a subsidized Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plan at healthcare.gov?\n\n_Exericise #2:_\n<br>\nImagine you are an entrepreneur, and it is \"Day 1\". Assume that you can only afford 25% of what you had planned for. In this scenario, your $200,000 annual spend becomes $50,000. What unique changes can you make? This exercise results in extreme ideas that you could later change to be less severe. \n\n_Exercise #3:_\n<br>\nLearn from others who have come before you. Here are 10 ideas that members of the Fast Follow Investor community have shared with me. You need NOT downsize your home, reduce the # of vacations you take, or eliminate a daily coffee habit!\n\nInstead, you might:\n\n1. Cancel subscriptions that you no longer use - save $1,000 each year\n2. Eliminate or reduce insurance premiums (life, long-term disability, auto) - $10,000\n3. Read/listen to books using Libby instead of purchasing on Amazon - $1,000\n4. Program your thermostat and lower the temperature on your water heater - $3,000\n5. Ask for coupon codes via a company website's chatbot before buying online - $1,000\n6. Transition to one car and save on maintenance, licensing, and insurance - $6,000\n7. Switch to a subsidized healthcare plan through healthcare.gov - $10,000\n8. Refinance your mortgage - $3,000\n9. Stop supporting your kids (cell phone bills, bank overdraft fees). They are adults now. - $1,000\n10. Commit to \"wait one week to buy\" after placing an item in your Amazon shopping cart - $4,000\n\nTotal annual savings: $40,000\n\nAnd don't fret about inflation. Even with inflation, [studies](https://www.kitces.com/blog/age-banding-by-basu-to-model-retirement-spending-needs-by-category/) show that the average retiree's spending drops by 25% for every 10 years in retirement. If you retire early, you should adjust that assumption. But, in case you don't believe me: think about how much your 85-year-old mother spends on travel, for example. Spending _in real terms_ declines as you age.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_Calculation:_\n($200K less $40K saved = $160K needed)/4% = $4M savings target, updated.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nWith reduced spending, we are now living a $5 Million retirement on $4 Million in savings. \n\nThat's $1 Million less savings required! How many fewer years of work is that? 10 years? More?\n\nBut we can do better...\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## #2: You will want to stay busy, so get paid for it.\n\nAny income earned in retirement is that much less you need to save! \n\nI often hear this concern: \"But wait, if I'm working then I'm not retired.\" Yes and no. It depends on how you're earning this retirement income. Also, after relaxing in retirement for a while, you may realize you need some purpose back in your life. Earning money _on your terms this time_ is a way to get it. For example, why not work a few half days at a local cafe? It's a great way to stay connected with friends and the community.\n\nMy grandfather and my father-in-law both worked in retirement for reasons beyond money.\n\n* My grandpa Kenny's career as a plumber lead him to work as a sales associate at his local Ace Hardware. Before taking the job, he confided in me about his boredom: \"Brian, I can only rotate the wheels on the vacuum cleaner so many times.\" At Ace Hardware, he helped customers find what they needed. But mostly, he loved chatting with them. My grandpa was an expert joke teller.\n* My father-in-law, Robin's situation was similar. He loves golf. Robin works several days a week now as a starter at his favorite golf course. He jokes with the golfing regulars all day. He spins his yarns. And he gets a paycheck. And free golf!\n\nI can think of several options for making money when retired.\n\n1. Rent out that extra room in your basement. Or, if you travel for part of the year, rent out your house during that time.\n2. While very few kickback permanently in retirement, it's especially true of early retirees. Those quicker to find financial independence are especially likely to pick up a new job or career. \n\n * Do you like people? Work part-time at your favorite coffee house. \n * Do you like books? Work at the library. \n * Are you fortunate enough to have seasonal skills? A retired accountant could pick up work during the busy tax season, then be off in time for the summer.\n * Do you like your former colleagues? You could consult with your former employer for part of the year.\n\n3. Perhaps you have a hobby or passion project. Find [1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) and watch the money roll in. My uncle-in-law, Howard, is the foremost expert on Mazda RX-7 and RX-8 cars. He's an absolute true fan of the Rotary engine. And he's an expert. Each year, Mazda RX fans spend oodles of time and money working with Howard.\n\n\nThe options are endless.\n\nHere are a few opportunities that add up to $80,000 per year:\n* Put your house on Airbnb or VRBO. Rent it out during an extended trip you take to earn $10,000.\n* Do seasonal work or part-time consulting. Charge $15,000 for each of the 3 months and earn $45,000.\n* Monetize a hobby or passion. Sell $250 worth of _something_ to 100 true fans to earn $25,000.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_Calculation:_\n($160K less $80K earned = $80K needed)/4% = $2M savings target, updated.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nWith some income in retirement, we are now living a $5 Million retirement on $2 Million in savings.  \n\nThat's another $2 Million less savings required! Wow. Let's find more...\n<br>\n<br>\n\n ## #3: Maximize the withdrawal rate on your savings\n\nThe final strategy is the easiest to implement. You need _not_ cut spending or monetize hobbies. Instead, just invest your nest egg smarter.\n\nLet's revisit the 4% rule that I used earlier. The rule first appeared in 1994 after studying a 60%-40% U.S. stock-to-bond portfolio over different 30 years periods in history. But, using a 4% safe withdrawal rate (SWR) is inaccurate for two important reasons.\n\n1. It is based on an inferior investment strategy (60/40). You can invest for greater return and less risk. \n2. It is timebound to 30 years. What if you want to stay retired for 35 years? 50 years? Or longer?\n\nInstead, let's use 5% as the corrected, perpetual withdrawal rate (PWR). To do so, the Fast Follow Investor strategy is necessary. I break it down further in this [post](to update with SWR/PWR post).\n\nSo, our $80,000 annual income in retirement no longer requires $2 Million in savings.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_Calculation:_\n$80K needed/updated 5% withdrawal rate = $1.6M savings target, updated.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThis is $400,000 less savings required. \n\nIn total, the three strategies reduced our retirement savings required by $3.4 Million. \n\nSo there you have it: with a little work, your $5 Million nest egg need only be $1.6 Million!\n\n$1.6 Million still requires work to build. To do it, I urge you to follow the [Idols Framework](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/13/this-is-my.html) for smarter wealth creation. But it is calming to know you needn't stay in your job decades longer to save an _unnecessary_, extra $3.4 Million.\n\nPlease, do this analysis for yourselves! \n\nI suspect many of you reading this are financially independent NOW. But, you may not have realized it. Make the jump. Take the plunge. You can do it.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Tweet</a><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://platform.linkedin.com/in.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">lang: en_US</script>\n<script type=\"IN/Share\" data-url=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/24/you-can-live.html\"></script>\nSubscribe to get my posts sent to your Inbox.

				"content_html": "<p><em>I offer my thesis, the &ldquo;Idols Framework for wealth creation&rdquo;, for your review. Calling for 25% Buffett, 25% Walton, 25% Bogle, and 25% Thorpe, it&rsquo;s a recipe for you to absorb, adopt, and adapt.</em>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I have refined my formula for smart wealth creation in the last five years. Is it a secret formula? No. Is it prescriptive or one-size-fits-all? No, and no.</p>\n<p>But, the formula has merit. And I wish I had known it earlier. The Idols Framework is foundational. With it in place, I can enjoy the adventure of life.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"enjoyable-stress-free-wealth-accumulation\">Enjoyable, stress-free wealth accumulation</h2>\n<p>You can determine the value of your time by calculating your earnings per hour worked. It makes sense to hire out jobs costing less than this measure. Unless you enjoy the job for other reasons (a hobby, for instance)&hellip;</p>\n<p>Successful individuals like <a href=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html\">Ed Thorpe</a> drive the measure higher: What is the most money you could earn for the least amount of work?</p>\n<p>My variation on personal <em>earnings per hour</em> adjusts the factors slightly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of <em>earnings</em>, I&rsquo;m interested in <em>wealth</em>.</li>\n<li>I redefine <em>time spent (per hour)</em> to <em>stress-level</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My measure becomes <em>wealth created per stress endured</em>. The goal is a high score.</p>\n<p>Two scenarios produce a high score:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&ldquo;The Bezos&rdquo; This is extreme wealth with significant stress. The high score is due to a large wealth factor.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;The Vagabond&rdquo; This is modest, even minimal wealth, with near zero stress. The high score can be attributed to a small stress factor.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If I had to pick one, I prefer &ldquo;The Vagabond&rdquo;. Stress is real, and it shortens lives. In the end, all we have is time.  Also, does extreme wealth make us happier?!</p>\n<p>But, I&rsquo;m shooting for somewhere in the middle. Likely, we all are. We would like <em>enough</em> wealth accumulated for the least stress. (<em>Enough</em> means financially independent.)</p>\n<p>How then?\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"idols-framework-for-wealth-creation\">Idols Framework for wealth creation</h2>\n<p>We will create wealth using the Idols Framework. It is a loose business and investment portfolio that I will dissect in great detail in future posts. For now, know that the Idols Framework starts with equal parts Buffett, Walton, Bogle, and Thorpe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% Warren Buffett, of Berkshire Hathaway fame [<strong>margin of safety</strong>]</li>\n<li>25% Sam Walton, from Walmart [<strong>micro-business</strong>]</li>\n<li>25% John Bogle, founder of Vanguard [<strong>buy &amp; hold indexing</strong>]</li>\n<li>25% <a href=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html\">Ed Thorpe</a>, math genius who beat Vegas and Wall Street [<strong>quantitative trend</strong>]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The prerequisite to employing the Idols Framework is simple. You must be great (top quartile) at two or more skills that you combine to provide unique value to a niche market.</p>\n<p>The perfect example is Scott Adams, cartoonist. He combined his skills of 1) drawing 2) comedy and 3) corporate experience to produce the successful &ldquo;Dilbert&rdquo; cartoon series. <a href=\"https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html\">Here</a> is his take.</p>\n<p>Early in life, you will build your skills and also your <strong>margin of safety</strong>. Also called an emergency fund, this is the Buffett slice of the Idols Framework. It provides work flexibility.</p>\n<p>Later, use this money to be opportunistic. With it, you can take advantage of major market declines (black swan events). Buy when everyone else is selling.</p>\n<p>Next, create a <strong>micro-business</strong>. Walton is the second slice, but not because Walmart is so giant. I choose <a href=\"https://pod.link/founders/episode/0d9ae711909cea651afe820cb7a9eb00\">Walton</a> to emulate because he&rsquo;s claimed he didn&rsquo;t create anything original. Sam Walton learned his best ideas from others. Then, he combined and aligned the ideas with his vision.</p>\n<p>I love this fact because it means <em>anyone</em> can start a business. Keep it very small (micro) to maintain sole control. Then, you alone can steer the business to low-stress waters.</p>\n<p>Real estate investment makes me anxious. I fear waking from a deep slumber to replace toilets in the middle of the night. But many disagree with me. Small-scale real estate investment also qualifies as a micro-business. In fact, I&rsquo;m advising my son to buy two four-plexes early in life.</p>\n<p>At last, the Bogle and Thorpe slices work together to compound your savings. I invest in two Vanguard index funds: 60% in VTI (US) and 40% in VXUS (non-US).

				"content_text": "_I offer my thesis, the \"Idols Framework for wealth creation\", for your review. Calling for 25% Buffett, 25% Walton, 25% Bogle, and 25% Thorpe, it's a recipe for you to absorb, adopt, and adapt._\n<n>\n<n>\n\nI have refined my formula for smart wealth creation in the last five years. Is it a secret formula? No. Is it prescriptive or one-size-fits-all? No, and no. \n\nBut, the formula has merit. And I wish I had known it earlier. The Idols Framework is foundational. With it in place, I can enjoy the adventure of life.\n<n>\n<n>\n\n## Enjoyable, stress-free wealth accumulation\n\nYou can determine the value of your time by calculating your earnings per hour worked. It makes sense to hire out jobs costing less than this measure. Unless you enjoy the job for other reasons (a hobby, for instance)... \n\nSuccessful individuals like [Ed Thorpe](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html) drive the measure higher: What is the most money you could earn for the least amount of work?\n\nMy variation on personal _earnings per hour_ adjusts the factors slightly.\n\n1) Instead of _earnings_, I'm interested in _wealth_.\n2) I redefine _time spent (per hour)_ to _stress-level_. \n\nMy measure becomes _wealth created per stress endured_. The goal is a high score.\n\nTwo scenarios produce a high score:\n\n1) \"The Bezos\" This is extreme wealth with significant stress. The high score is due to a large wealth factor.\n2) \"The Vagabond\" This is modest, even minimal wealth, with near zero stress. The high score can be attributed to a small stress factor.\n\nIf I had to pick one, I prefer \"The Vagabond\". Stress is real, and it shortens lives. In the end, all we have is time.  Also, does extreme wealth make us happier?!  \n\nBut, I'm shooting for somewhere in the middle. Likely, we all are. We would like _enough_ wealth accumulated for the least stress. (_Enough_ means financially independent.)\n\nHow then?\n<n>\n<n>\n\n## Idols Framework for wealth creation\n\nWe will create wealth using the Idols Framework. It is a loose business and investment portfolio that I will dissect in great detail in future posts. For now, know that the Idols Framework starts with equal parts Buffett, Walton, Bogle, and Thorpe:\n \n* 25% Warren Buffett, of Berkshire Hathaway fame [**margin of safety**]\n* 25% Sam Walton, from Walmart [**micro-business**]\n* 25% John Bogle, founder of Vanguard [**buy & hold indexing**]\n* 25% [Ed Thorpe](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html), math genius who beat Vegas and Wall Street [**quantitative trend**]\n\nThe prerequisite to employing the Idols Framework is simple. You must be great (top quartile) at two or more skills that you combine to provide unique value to a niche market.\n\nThe perfect example is Scott Adams, cartoonist. He combined his skills of 1) drawing 2) comedy and 3) corporate experience to produce the successful \"Dilbert\" cartoon series. [Here](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html) is his take.\n\nEarly in life, you will build your skills and also your **margin of safety**. Also called an emergency fund, this is the Buffett slice of the Idols Framework. It provides work flexibility. \n\nLater, use this money to be opportunistic. With it, you can take advantage of major market declines (black swan events). Buy when everyone else is selling.\n\nNext, create a **micro-business**. Walton is the second slice, but not because Walmart is so giant. I choose [Walton](https://pod.link/founders/episode/0d9ae711909cea651afe820cb7a9eb00) to emulate because he's claimed he didn't create anything original. Sam Walton learned his best ideas from others. Then, he combined and aligned the ideas with his vision.  \n\nI love this fact because it means _anyone_ can start a business. Keep it very small (micro) to maintain sole control. Then, you alone can steer the business to low-stress waters.\n\nReal estate investment makes me anxious. I fear waking from a deep slumber to replace toilets in the middle of the night. But many disagree with me. Small-scale real estate investment also qualifies as a micro-business. In fact, I'm advising my son to buy two four-plexes early in life.\n\nAt last, the Bogle and Thorpe slices work together to compound your savings. I invest in two Vanguard index funds: 60% in VTI (US) and 40% in VXUS (non-US). These percentages align with the market capitalization of the world stock market.\n\nThe Idols Framework's last slice is my [Fast Follow Investor](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/) strategy. It replicates **quantitative trend** models built on Ed Thorpe’s early work. The strategy provides deep diversification alongside market-based, passive, **buy & hold indexing** (VTI/ VXUS). \n\nThese investment models need no investment expertise. But you must stay diligent. This is easier said than done. In fact, it's the human side of investing that is the most difficult. \n\nOne can practice a level-headed temperament with good planning, habit-building, and support. I write a lot about [this](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/01/30/the-great-one.html).\n\nI list the four slices of the Idols framework at 25% each, but percentages do vary for me. And they will for you. In fact, they _should_ flex as you move through life. They will vary based on life stage, the economy, and when opportunities or risks present themselves.\n<n>\n<n>\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nNow, let's revisit our _wealth created per stress endured_ measure. We achieve a high score by accumulating _enough_ wealth with very little stress:\n\n* The Bogle and Thorpe investment models are proven and mindless to use.\n* With Walton, you stay small (micro!) and navigate your work life as you see fit.\n* And Buffett's margin of safety provides additional padding... so you can \"be greedy when others are fearful\".\n\nGreat wealth with little stress. Magic.\n\n> Follow the Idols Framework to run a self-directed, micro-business with cash on hand to take advantage of undervalued assets all the while producing high investment returns that are fully diversified.\n\nThat sentence is long.

I finished his autobiography last week. He offers a great personal blueprint for living your life. If these highlights inspire you, I urge you to read the entire book. Ed has so much to offer.</p>\n<p>I had not known of Ed Thorpe until 2021. He is the first modern mathematician to investigate <em>risk</em> and achieve great financial success doing so. He devised ways to beat the casinos in blackjack and roulette. Later, he used similar techniques to win at investing with his hedge fund, Princeton Newport Partners.</p>\n<p>His mathematical perspectives on investments underpin the <a href=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/\">fastfollowinvestor.com</a> investing strategy. And the book details it in a way we can all understand.</p>\n<p>But, Ed&rsquo;s approach to life serves up even more lessons.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Man-All-Markets-Street-Dealer-ebook/dp/B00SEFEYCI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1674765641&amp;sr=8-1\">A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market</a>, Ed takes us on his journey from depression-era Chicago to MIT to mafia-controlled Las Vegas and finally Wall Street. Then, suddenly, he casts all of his professional success aside.</p>\n<p>At its core, this is a book about how to live your best life.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What matters in life is how you spend your time. Life is like reading a novel or running a marathon. It’s not so much about reaching a goal but rather about the journey itself and the experiences along the way.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ed learned from Benjamin Franklin (another favorite of mine) who became financially independent at 42 years old. It was Franklin who said:</p>\n<p>“Time is the stuff life is made of, and how you spend it makes all the difference.&quot;</p>\n<p>Franklin followed his own interests in his next 42 years, and his accomplishments are remarkable.</p>\n<p>Ed Thorpe advises that we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stay independent and in control of our lives</li>\n<li>Keep humble</li>\n<li>Be great, not grand (Don&rsquo;t get big for big&rsquo;s sake.)</li>\n<li>Strive for simplicity</li>\n<li>Develop systems for everything in life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On investing, Ed believes in finding a simple edge and betting on yourself. At the same time, you must control the size of your bets to cap any losses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;I also believed then, as I do now after more than fifty years as a money manager, that the surest way to get rich is to play only those gambling games or make those investments where I have an edge.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;A good defense keeps other people from taking your money. As Warren Buffett said: &lsquo;In order to succeed you must first survive. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the book, Ed clarifies these points with a sports analogy. The very best teams have both a very good offense and a very good defense. Neither has to be the best, but both must be strong to win championships.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to close by giving Ed the last words:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When Princeton Newport Partners closed, Vivian (Ed&rsquo;s wife) and I had money enough for the rest of our lives&hellip;. it freed us to do more of what we enjoyed most: spend time with each other and the family and friends we loved, travel, and pursue our interests.</p>\n<p>Taking to heart the lyrics of the song “Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later than You Think),” Vivian and I would make the most of the one thing we could never have enough of—time together.

				"content_text": "_Ed Thorpe is a mathematical genius, but his approach to life is what most impresses me._\n<n>\n\nEd Thorpe is a beacon to me. I finished his autobiography last week. He offers a great personal blueprint for living your life. If these highlights inspire you, I urge you to read the entire book. Ed has so much to offer.\n\nI had not known of Ed Thorpe until 2021. He is the first modern mathematician to investigate _risk_ and achieve great financial success doing so. He devised ways to beat the casinos in blackjack and roulette. Later, he used similar techniques to win at investing with his hedge fund, Princeton Newport Partners. \n\nHis mathematical perspectives on investments underpin the [fastfollowinvestor.com](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/) investing strategy. And the book details it in a way we can all understand.\n\nBut, Ed's approach to life serves up even more lessons.\n\nIn [A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market](https://www.amazon.com/Man-All-Markets-Street-Dealer-ebook/dp/B00SEFEYCI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1674765641&sr=8-1), Ed takes us on his journey from depression-era Chicago to MIT to mafia-controlled Las Vegas and finally Wall Street. Then, suddenly, he casts all of his professional success aside. \n\nAt its core, this is a book about how to live your best life.\n\n\"What matters in life is how you spend your time. Life is like reading a novel or running a marathon. It’s not so much about reaching a goal but rather about the journey itself and the experiences along the way.\"\n\nEd learned from Benjamin Franklin (another favorite of mine) who became financially independent at 42 years old. It was Franklin who said:\n\n“Time is the stuff life is made of, and how you spend it makes all the difference.\" \n\nFranklin followed his own interests in his next 42 years, and his accomplishments are remarkable. \n\nEd Thorpe advises that we:\n* Stay independent and in control of our lives\n* Keep humble\n* Be great, not grand (Don't get big for big's sake.) \n* Strive for simplicity\n* Develop systems for everything in life\n\nOn investing, Ed believes in finding a simple edge and betting on yourself. At the same time, you must control the size of your bets to cap any losses.\n \n* \"I also believed then, as I do now after more than fifty years as a money manager, that the surest way to get rich is to play only those gambling games or make those investments where I have an edge.\"\n* \"A good defense keeps other people from taking your money. As Warren Buffett said: 'In order to succeed you must first survive. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.'.\"\n\nIn the book, Ed clarifies these points with a sports analogy. The very best teams have both a very good offense and a very good defense. Neither has to be the best, but both must be strong to win championships.\n\nI'd like to close by giving Ed the last words:\n\n\"When Princeton Newport Partners closed, Vivian (Ed's wife) and I had money enough for the rest of our lives.... it freed us to do more of what we enjoyed most: spend time with each other and the family and friends we loved, travel, and pursue our interests. \n\nTaking to heart the lyrics of the song “Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later than You Think),” Vivian and I would make the most of the one thing we could never have enough of—time together. Success on Wall Street was getting the most money. Success for us was having the best life. \n\nWhatever you do, enjoy your life and the people who share it with you, and leave something good of yourself for the generations to follow. \"\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Tweet</a><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://platform.linkedin.com/in.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">lang: en_US</script>\n<script type=\"IN/Share\" data-url=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2023/02/02/consider-studying-notable.html\"></script>\nSubscribe to get my posts sent to your Inbox.

I remember thinking, \"I've just lost 6 years of savings...6 years of sacrifice.\"\n\nAt least I didn't pass out like I almost did at Six Flags.\n\nNow, let me fast forward through 18 months when I read everything about investing that I could get my hands on. \n\nI had found an investing strategy to complement my Buy & Hold portfolio.  \n\nIt's a great diversifier, without dilution. Meaning, it enhances my investment returns.  And, best of all, it reduces my risk of severe loss and helps me sleep better at night.\n\nTactical Asset Allocation (TAA). It's the investing strategy I teach at [FastFollowInvestor.com](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/).\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Comparing two strategies\n\nTo learn TAA, I checked much of what I already knew about investing at the door. Like Adam Grant recommends in [Think Again](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H177WQP/?coliid=I2PL85ONHI4XTC&colid=1S0KE6JUF28QU&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it_im), I had to 1) unlearn and 2) relearn.\n\nTake a look at these comparisons I've drawn:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/f0156b8115.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThere is a lot here, I know. It took me almost a year to understand TAA. It's new and different. And it doesn't always align with popular beliefs.\n\nSo, this is my challenge: **How can I best share this strategy so everyone benefits?**\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Expanding the analogy \n\nDerek Thompson, one of my [favorite podcasters](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/plain-english-with-derek-thompson/id1594471023), speaks in analogies. \n\nIt can help new ideas stick. So let me try one.\n\nI think of Buy & Hold investing like that ride on a roller coaster. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/424c3e28f2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"349\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n\nA roller coaster entertains riders with steep climbs and steeper drops. \n\nYou must put your trust in the ride because you have no control. \n\nFor long stretches, there is a lot of up and down, but you make no vertical progress. \n\nBut, riding is easy. You get on the ride and go (think: set it and forget it).\n<br>\n<br>\n\nTactical Asset Allocation (TAA) is more like a mountain trek.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/c180f5ae4e.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n\nHiking a mountain takes preparation and, sometimes, training. \n\nYou choose your path, and so control your destiny. \n\nWhile you may need to backtrack, it's minimal if you plan your route well. \n\nWhen you reach the summit, you're exhausted but feel great given the achievement.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Use both for strong diversification\n\n**Buy & Hold and TAA are valid investing strategies.**\n\nYou can expect positive returns from both. But, one may work better than the other in certain situations. \n\nOne obvious use case: the new saver has time to reap rewards from Buy & Hold.  The soon-to-be retiree does not have the time and should tilt her/his portfolio toward TAA.\n\n**Buy & Hold and TAA are excellent diversifying strategies.**\n \nTogether, they reduce your portfolio's overall volatility and don't dilute investment returns. Diversification, not diworsification. \n\nAnd how fortunate this is! Take a small piece of your Buy & Hold portfolio and try it out. Dipping your toe in the TAA waters is a good way to learn something new and manage risk at the same time.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nWhen you're ready for more, you can watch my trades monthly in real-time at [FastFollowInvestor.com](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/).\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Tweet</a><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://platform.linkedin.com/in.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">lang: en_US</script>\n<script type=\"IN/Share\" data-url=\"https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/23/buy-hold-investing.html\"></script>\nSubscribe to get my posts sent to your Inbox.

				"content_text": "_In the past 40 years, we've seen only two types of U.S. economy. A new and different economy could be right around the corner. What is it?_\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/6113699a9d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"597\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n\nIf you're familiar with San Franciso, you're familiar with microclimates. \n\nOn a summer day, it may be 55 deg. in the City, 75 deg. in Alameda (where I live), and 95. deg in Concord (where my son goes to school).\n\nIt's no wonder that the #1 memento for a San Francisco tourist is a sweatshirt. You think California summer, and you think hot. Nope. Fog covers the City, pulled on shore by the Bay Area's inland heat. And it's cold.\n\nThe simple lesson? Be ready for all kinds of weather.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## All weather investing portfolios\n\nThis analogy has infiltrated investment-speak over the years.\n\nThe most direct is Ray Dalio's All Weather investment portfolio (1996). \nIt holds roughly 30% stocks, 40% long-term bonds, 15% short-term bonds, 7.5% gold, and 7.5% commodities.\n\nOther examples:\n\n* Permanent portfolio (1982) from Harry Browne, holding 25% stocks, 25% long-term bonds, 25% cash, and 25% gold.\n* Dragon portfolio (2020) from Chris Cole. It holds 20% stocks, 20% long-term bonds, 20% gold, 20% commodity trend, and 20% long volatility.\n\nIf this post is getting complicated fast for you, do not worry. \n\nI name these investment portfolios for one reason. Smart investors with [very long investment horizons](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/15/what-eddie-izzard.html) consider all types of U.S. economies. Or as I will call them: economic regimes.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## What are the four economic regimes?\n\nEconomic regimes depend on two factors that interact: Growth and Inflation. \n\nIf we match levels of Growth (positive or negative) with Inflation (yes or no), we arrive at four economic regimes:\n\n* Expansion (real): economic growth and no price inflation\n* Expansion (nominal): economic growth with price inflation\n* Recession: economic decline and no price inflation\n* Stagflation: economic decline with price inflation\n\nAssessing recent history:\n\n* For the last ~40 years (1980 to 2021), we've swung between expansion (real) and recession.\n* 2021/2 included 18 months of expansion (nominal-with inflation).\n* And, as we look to 2023, we are teetering between continued expansion (nominal) and stagflation.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Why is this important?\n\nConsider these questions: \n\n1. What type of investments work best in expansionary times? Stocks. \n2. How about in recessions? Bonds.\n\nThis is good: We have access to stocks and bonds in our 401Ks, IRAs, and brokerage accounts.\n\n3. What about expansionary times with inflation? Stocks, yes, but also (and more so) commodities!\n4. How about during stagflation? Commodities again. And gold.\n\n\n**This is a problem! Most investors can't access commodities and gold as investments.**\n\nInflation really messes things up. If it sticks around, we need alternatives to stocks and bonds for continued investment success.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Your easy-to-understand 2x2 matrix\n\nIn my 20s, I worked for a manager who looked at life through 2x2 matrices. Every situation. Every decision. Everything could be framed by a 2x2.\n\nWell, so can economic regimes.\n\nThe four quadrants that define our four economic regimes are defined here:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/db174837dc.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"179\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n\nFor those interested in my research, here is a link to the key chart.\n \n<img src=\"uploads/2022/82ab175552.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"412\" alt=\"\" />\n<br>\n\nAnd for even more excruciating details, refer to [this]( https://mcusercontent.com/6750faf5c6091bc898da154ff/files/006447b8-279d-8aed-22b6-cde5a5b2e61d/20221103.IF.Multi_AssetInflatonDeck.BBG.pdf ). \n<br>\n<br>\n\n## All Weather portfolios make a comeback\n\nI mentioned early on that several all-weather portfolios do exist.\nBut few know about them, for these reasons:\n\n* They have been out of favor because they have underperformed. We've experienced zero inflation in the past 40 years. So, commodities and gold have been a drag on investment returns.\n* We aren't educated on all-weather portfolios. The mutual fund industry -and the stock/bond funds it touts- has grown massively in the last 40 years. And this aligns with just two of four economic regimes. [Our own short-term thinking limits us](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/12/15/what-eddie-izzard.html).\n* Until recently, portfolios with commodities and gold have been hard to set up. Only hedge funds, family offices, and other \"big money\" played in these assets.\n<br>\n \nPortfolios that accommodate all economic regimes may have been out of favor for 40 years. But, they may soon make a comeback.\n\n2022 and 2023 appear to be years of economic change. It's time to learn more!\n\nAnd, wouldn't it be cool if there was a more fluid all-weather portfolio? \n\nWhat if you could move money to the best performers when economic regimes changed?\n\nThat's what I do at [fastfollowinvestor.com](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/).\n<br>\n<br>\n\nSubscribe to get my posts sent to your Inbox.

				"content_text": "_Despite popular belief, you need NOT accept market risk._\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\nLast week I [shared](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html) that Meta would need to double two times over (grow 300%) to recover from its 75% loss in 2022.\n\nI have been thinking a lot about how to better convey the sheer tragedy of this fact.\n\nImagine that you are two years to retirement.  You're only two years away from \"hanging it up\"... \"living the good life\". You have $2M in savings and are feeling pretty good.\n\nThen, over the next six months, your investments drops to $500K (75% loss). \n\nHow would you feel? \n\nI know how I would. Lots of tears.

(Neither am I.) \n\nSevere losses, though, aren't limited to individual stocks!\n\nLet's take a look back at some inopportune years to retire:\n\n-----\n\n2008: The Subprime Mortgage Crisis\nS&P 500 loss: 57%\nTime to recover: 17 months \n\n2000: The Dotcom Bubble\nNasdaq loss: 77% \nTime to recover: 15 years \n\n1973: The Oil Crisis and Economic Recession\nMarket loss: 48% \nTime to recover: 21 months \n\n1929: The Worst Crash in History\nDow loss: 89%\nTime to recover: 25 years.\n\n-----\n\nEntire markets can drop 50%+. And the road to recovery can vary: from  17 months (when the Fed gets involved) to 25 years (when it does not).\n\nSignificant market drops are normal.\n\nBut accepting market risk is not required. \n\nFast Follow investors cut our losses. In doing so, we manage market risk. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n_Take control and never utter \"It's bad timing, I guess. I'm heading back to work.\"_\n<br>\n<br>\n\n \nI hope that you've enjoyed my short series on minimizing loss.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\nIn summary:\n\n*Entire markets can drop by 50% or more, setting you way back. \n\n*[Investment losses](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/2022/10/30/meta-has-crashed.html) are asymmetric and compound exponentially.
