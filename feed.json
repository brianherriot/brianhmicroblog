				"content_text": "Hello! \n\nI look forward to meeting everyone as I create a new community of do-it-yourself investors.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nTo start, let me introduce myself.\n\nI'm a husband of 20+ years, father of 10+ years, and management consultant/ business owner.\n\nBorn and raised in Wisconsin, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n\nI'm fascinated with investments and the economy. I have recently become intrigued by purpose and passion. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nWhy [fastfollowinvestor.com](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/)? That's easy... I'm introducing do-it-yourself investors to a personal investment strategy called [Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/invest-like-me/). \n\nTAA generates investment returns for you to achieve financial independence. And it protects against losses so you can sleep well in this wonderful, new stage of life.\n\nMore DIY investors should know about it.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nAt [fastfollowinvestor.com](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/), I want my posts to show some personality and prove enjoyable to read.\n \nIf I do it right, we'll also learn together and have fun doing it. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nA little more about me:\n\n1. Friends tell me that I'm great to watch a comedy with. They laugh at me laughing at the movie.\n\n2. A storm in New Orleans flooded my car up to the steering wheel. A total loss.\n\n3. You will want to cook dinner for me because every meal I eat is the best meal I've ever had.\n\n4. I love swimming, skiing, and other fun on the lake. My grandparents owned a cabin in Northern Wisconsin, and now my wife and I do too!\n\n5. My sister competed in the Miss America pageant!\n\n6. My spirit animal is a dog. I'm a dependable and trusted companion, and I always live in the present (both good and bad).\n\n7. Our terrier, Izzie, is over 15 years old and still escaping from the yard.\n\n8. One regret I have in life is not traveling for long periods overseas when I was younger. I want to make up for that soon.\n\n9. Life granted me a great many privileges and only in the last several years have I realized it.\n\n10. I have been thinking about writing for a long time and now simply must do it. I'm very excited to start this adventure with you!\n<br>\n<br>\n\nYou can receive my posts on money, the economy, and TAA monthly by clicking [Subscribe](https://fastfollowinvestor.com/subscribe/). \n<br>\n<br>\n\nI can't wait to get to know you better. \n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!
